0810-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Stephen J. Mignano, J.
The claimant is the owner of a 22.06-acre parcel of land adjoining the westerly right-of-way of the Taconic State Parkway (hereinafter Taconic) in the Town of East Fishkill (see exhibit 11) . Claimant seeks damages as a result of an April 15, 1999 appropriation by the New York State Department of Transportation pursuant to section 30 of the Highway Law and .the Eminent Domain Procedure Law, not of lands, but of any right of “access” that the property has to the Taconic.
While somewhat complex, the essential facts of the matter are undisputed. On April 15, 1999 a taking map and description were filed with the Dutchess County Clerk under map No. 1025 and parcel No. 1034. The appropriation filing described by metes and bounds depicted the same 9.534-acre portion of the right-of-way of the Taconic which was described and depicted in map No. 83, an appropriation map filed in 1936 by the Taconic State Park Commission.
The 1999 filing indicated that its purpose was not to secure any additional lands but was “to prohibit access” and that
“The purpose of this map is to fully prohibit the right of access to and from abutting property where same had heretofore been allowed to adjacent owners under Map No. 83 for the Taconic State Park Commission, a certified copy of which was filed in the Office of the Clerk of Dutchess County on March 28, 1936” (see map and description attached to amended claim).
On March 26, 1936, under its map No. 83, the Taconic State Park Commission appropriated the 9.534-acre parcel in fee simple absolute from the claimant’s remote predecessor-in-interest, Cornelius W. Garrison. The taking was a roughly rectangular area, 350 feet wide by 1,200 feet long from south to north through the Garrison property. The 1936 appropriation was for the purpose of creating the right-of-way, laying out and constructing the Taconic.
The lands appropriated in 1936 were part of a 120±-acre former dairy farm (see exhibit 10) but as of March 26, 1936, the premises had not been “used for dairy or farming purposes . . . for a period of about eight years [the period of Garrison’s ownership] [and] the buildings on the premises were not in good condition and all of them were in need of repair” (exhibit 10 IN 11, 12) .
The 1936 parkway right-of-way appropriation effectively divided the property into two segments. One 22±-acre parcel lay to the east of the parkway corridor. The remaining larger segment, 90± acres, lay to the west of the parkway right-of-way.
A claim was brought as a result of the 1936 appropriation and resolved in this court. I
In subsequent years, the Taconic was constructed oh the lands appropriated as a limited access, restricted-use roadway with public access only at interchanges or intersections with public roadways. I
Claimant’s property is a portion of Garrison’s 90±-acre tract on the west side of the parkway right-of-way. It isj located a fairly uniform distance of 100 feet from the easterly edge of the southbound travel lanes of the Taconic.
A dirt and gravel lane, at least 100 feet long and approximately 12 to 16 feet wide, leads from the southbojund travel lanes of the Taconic to the westerly edge of the right-of-way through the landscaped buffer area. In the years since the construction of the Taconic in 1939, it intermittently has served as an access driveway to the former Garrison, novf Orchard Grove, property from the Taconic.
The driveway begins at a point directly opposite Bogardus Lane, an improved, two-lane, paved roadway of thé Town of East Fishkill, which intersects the Taconic at grade from the east. Prior to 1999, a paved median roadway also extended east to west from the northbound travel lanes to the southbound travel lanes of the Taconic permitting unrestricted crossing and turning from Bogardus Lane. It is not known if Bogardus Lane was a public road of the Town of East Fishkill in 1936: when the initial appropriation was made or whether any part of ¡Bogardus Lane, even assuming it was a town road, reached what is now the claimant’s property.
The testimony of the current and former Superintendents of Highways for the Town of East Fishkill, Dennis Miller! and Kenneth McKeown, was offered at trial on the issue of whether Bogardus Lane west of the Taconic was a town road. The testimony established that Bogardus Lane West was never p^tved and widened like the segment of Bogardus Lane on the east, but that the town highway workers have plowed snow from Bogardus Lane West from time to time to allow the resident of what is now claimant’s property to gain access to the Taconic. Without reference to any maps or official records of the Town from the time of the 1936 appropriation, the superintendents referred to the driveway as a westerly spur or cul-de-sac of Bogardus Lane. Neither could say how or when Bogardus Lane became a town road.
In 1994, Orchard Grove of Dutchess, Inc., as contract vendee, applied to the New York State Department of Transportation (hereinafter DOT) for a highway access permit to allow the enlargement and improvement of the dirt and gravel driveway. Claimant sought to widen the driveway to 50 feet, install drainage facilities and pave its length to provide an access roadway to the 22-acre property from the travel lanes of the Taconic. Improvement of the access was necessary to the success of an application the claimant had made to the Planning Board of the Town of East Fishkill to allow subdivision of the parcel into an 18-lot residential development.
DOT, which assumed jurisdiction over the ownership, operation and management of the Taconic as successor to the Taconic State Parkway Commission, denied the application. In a letter dated June 20, 1995 from J.W. Wickeri, Permit Engineer, the claimant’s principal was told that
“It is the Department’s position that the additional turning movements and cross traffic generated by the development of this 22± acres will jeopardize the safe operation of this intersection; we therefore, have concluded that we will not grant approval to improve the westerly leg of Bogardus Lane as proposed, but will proceed to acquire the property or the rights of access to the Parkway via Bogardus Lane” (see exhibit 5).
Despite denial of the needed driveway/access permit, the seeming frustration of the planned subdivision, and DOT’s advice that it would acquire the property rather than permit the access sought, claimant purchased the property on June 5, 1997. Claimant’s appraiser, Donald M. McGrath, Jr., offered evidence of the value of the claimant’s property as a potential subdivision with access to the Taconic and the value of the lands without such access. A total of $365,000 in damages iis claimed (see exhibit 11).
Lee Ann McCollum testified at trial on behalf of claimant. She testified that she was employed by Crystal Clear Abstract Corp. and her experience included conducting title searches for over 25 years including over 17 years of experience: as a title examiner.
Ms. McCollum testified that her company conducted a thorough search of the land title records in the office of the Dutchess County Clerk as they related to the subject and her review did not uncover any restrictions on the subject property having access to the west portion of Bogardus Lane. She referred to the State’s 1936 taking from claimant’s remote predecessor-in-interest, Mr. Garrison, and stated that nowhere in the previously filed taking papers was there language that the taking was without access. However, the witness was unable to point to any recorded instrument in the chain of title which created such access. In fact, the only reference to such access was quitclaim language in a deed executed in 1969 (exhibit jl3) which purported to convey such rights as the then grantor had, “if any.” At the end of her testimony, the witness simply stated that the access existed by adverse possession. As discussed infra, this position was erroneous. It is also noteworthy that while the title insurance company issued this opinion it di|d not affirmatively insure this access for the property. Whether claimant ever requested such affirmative insurance is not clear to the court.
With the salient facts of the matter firmly established, the court’s analysis turns to the threshold issue of whether claimant had any vested right of access/egress to the Taconic that was, in fact, taken by the State in 1999.
Like virtually all other property rights, rights of access/egress are created by express terms of a recorded instrument, necessity or prescription. In the instant matter, the documentary evidence submitted to the court, as well as the testimony of claimant’s title examiner, demonstrates conclusively that no express grant of access/egress was ever created to run; with the claimant’s property. ;
The 1936 appropriation by the State bisected what was then one large parcel. The parkway which was eventually constructed through the parcel did not provide for free and open access to abutting landowners. In fact, as the State points out, the source of legislative authority for the 1936 appropriation was not the Highway Law but rather the predecessor statute to what is now known as the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law. Such appropriations are deemed to be appropriations of parkland in their entirety regardless of whether a parkway is subsidiarily built within that land. As a result, the 1936 appropriation did not include the more typical rights of access to a highway which are accorded to abutting landowners (Matter of County of Westchester [Hutchinson Riv. Parkway], 246 NY 314 [1927]; Perlmutter v Greene, 259 NY 327 [1932]). Based upon the documentary evidence of the 1936 taking, it is clear to the court that no express or implied rights-of-access were reserved to Garrison as a result of the 1936 appropriation.
As a result, the court finds that there is no instrument in the chain of title which would grant an express right-of-access/egress to the claimant as of the date of the 1999 “appropriation.”
Having determined that there is no express grant of access/ egress in claimant’s chain of title, the court next examines easement by necessity. Simply put, there is no evidence in this record to require (or support) this court finding an easement by necessity accrued to claimant’s property. On this point, the only testimony in the record amounts to a conclusory allegation that the parcel is landlocked. There is no testimony establishing the elements of necessity and no evidence whatsoever that the State should be in any different position from the other landowners surrounding claimant’s parcel in this regard. Thus, on this record, I cannot determine that an easement of necessity existed as a matter of law in 1999.
Finally, rights-of-access/egress can be created by prescription. However, prescriptive rights, sounding in adverse possession, are not available in the case at bar since adverse possession is never available against the State in its governmental capacity (People v System Props., 2 NY2d 330 [1957]; Peasley v State of New York, 102 Misc 2d 982 [1980]; 96 NY Jur 2d, State of New York § 153; see, City of New York v Sarnelli Bros., 280 AD2d 573 [2001]; see also, Casini v Sea Gate Assn., 262 AD2d 593 [1999]).
In summary, this court now determines that the 1936 appropriation of the lands of Garrison did not leave any residual rights-of-access to the Taconic from the property of Garrison which was bisected by the appropriation. As a ijesult, the quitclaim language contained in the 1969 deed from Taub to Freedmann (exhibit 13) could not create such right and the conclusion of claimant’s title company to the contrary was in error. Acquiescence by the State to the use of the driveway by claimant’s predecessors-in-interest afforded permissive and practical access but not a permanent legal right-of-access (see, Pollak v State of New York, 41 NY2d 909, 910 [1977]).
Despite my holding regarding the effect of the 1936 ¡appropriation, additional analysis is implicated by virtue of the"" testimony of Dennis Miller and Kenneth McKeown. Briefly stated, Mr. Miller testified that the Town of East Fishkill maintained, repaired and plowed Bogardus Lane for many years. | This calls into question whether any vested rights were created by statute subsequent to 1936 and prior to the 1999 “taking.”
Mr. Miller testified that the Town lists Bogardus Ljane on its official Inventory of Town Roads (exhibit 16), is reimbursed by the State of New York for plowing Bogardus Lane based upon this inventory and that the 16-foot-wide driveway located to the west of the Taconic is included in this delineation ofj Bogardus Lane. While there is no record of the Town Board taking any action to declare this area a public roadway or dedicating land to this purpose, claimant relied upon these actions of the Town subsequent to 1936. |
Mr. Miller further testified that prior to 1986 the town had “paved” the 16-foot wide right-of-way with oil and stone. Nonetheless, he conceded that Bogardus Lane east of the Taconic consists of an imperviously surfaced, 30-foot roadway ¡while Bogardus Lane West is essentially a 16-foot wide driveway. Mr. Miller’s testimony raises an issue as to whether this driveway became a town road by virtue of public use and maintenance under Highway Law § 189. !
Although claimant never cited to the Highway Law, it is clear that the testimony of Mr. Miller was introduced for the purpose of obtaining a declaration that Bogardus Lane West became a public highway by virtue of the town maintenance of the road. The court does not agree.
Pursuant to Highway Law § 189, lands which are used by the public as a highway for a period of 10 years or more shall become a highway. Case law has established that public use, by itself, is not enough. There must also be evidence of maintenance and repair by the local public authorities (see, Salvador v New York State Dept. of Transp., 234 AD2d 741 [1996]; Hillelson v Grover, 105 AD2d 484 [1984]).
In the first instance, Highway Law § 189 has never been applied against the lands of the State of New York. The court can find no case in which a public highway was declared as a result of either public use or town maintenance where the owner of the fee in question was the State. This result would appear required by the strong public policy prohibiting the use of adverse possession and prescriptive rights against the State (see, People v System Props., 2 NY2d 330 [1957], supra; Peasley v State of New York, 102 Misc 2d 982 [1980], supra; 96 NY Jur 2d, State of New York § 153, supra; see, City of New York v Sarnelli Bros., 280 AD2d 573 [2001], supra; see also, Casini v Sea Gate Assn., 262 AD2d 593 [1999], supra).
Further, Highway Law § 189 requires “public” use. However, all of the evidence and testimony before this court indicate that the most intense historical use of this driveway was for one owner to access his single-family home. This essentially private use of a driveway does not rise to the level of “public” use comprehended by Highway Law § 189. Therefore, quite apart from the proscription of adverse possession against the State, the court holds that the access in question does not qualify for a declaration of public roadway under Highway Law § 189.
Despite the court’s holding that the claimant possesses no vested right, whether express, implied, prescriptive or statutory, there remain several questions regarding the State’s own actions over the years. Specifically, evidence at trial indicated that the State had acceded to the use of the driveway from claimant’s property to the Taconic. During this time, the State installed, or permitted, a traffic control sign and a directional sign. In addition, the question might reasonably be asked what the DOT thought it was doing in 1999 when it issued the supplementary takings map (exhibit 6) to “fully prohibit the right of access to and from abutting property where same had heretofore been allowed to adjacent owners under Map No. 83.”
Claimant reasonably points out, and at first blush lit does appear, that the State itself believed that there was some residual vested right-of-access held by claimant and this right required appropriation if access to the Taconic was to be terminated. However, based upon this record and the analysis set forth at length above, the court can find no basis in law requiring the State to allow any access, much less an expanded access, in perpetuity. The State’s sufferance of the use of its lanjd was not required by any easement, statute or contract before this court. As a result, the court finds that to the extent the State permitted access over the driveway from claimant’s property to the Taconic, such permission constituted, at most, a license and, at the least, a gratuitous benefit conferred upon the property owner. Either could be terminated at any time. Such gratuitous benefits do not create any compensable vested right in the claimant under either the United States or New liork State Constitution (Matter of Low, 233 NY 334 [1922]).
The principal issue in Low (supra) is directly on point in the case at bar. In that matter, abutting landowners in ¡New York City had constructed underground vaults which encroached upon City streets. When the City directed their removal in preparation for construction of the subway system, tlje owners claimed compensation for the “taking” and the court held “The permits granted for this purpose were revokable . . . and did not constitute, in our judgement, a right, privilege, franchise or easement ... for which compensation was to be made when such were taken or destroyed” (Matter of Low, 233 NY 334 ,340 [1922], supra).
While Low (supra) was decided in 1922, the seminal principle of the case remains good law today and the doctrine that gratuitous governmental benefits do not confer vested property rights remains vibrant in many areas of modern law (see, Bavaro v Parente, 96 AD2d 519 [1983]; Gluck v City of Syracuse, 244 AD2d 873 [1997]; Town of Esopus v State of New York, 166 Misc 2d 36 [1995]).
As a result of this analysis, the court finds that the ¡actions of state employees in issuing the 1999 takings map (éxhibit 6) were merely surplus actions not required by law. These erroneous actions by governmental employees cannot bind ¡the State and cannot create rights in a private individual where no such rights otherwise exist. In effect, neither legal nor equitable (estoppel) remedies are available against a governmental unit to ratify an administrative error (see, Matter of Parkview Assoc. v City of New York, 71 NY2d 274 [1988]; Morley v Arricale, 66 NY2d 665 [1985]).
A final issue requiring resolution in this matter is the motion by the State requesting that this court strike claimant’s appraisal. The motion was made at the close of the claimant’s case and again upon submission of the matter. I reserved decision on both motions and they are decided jointly at this time.
The basis of the State’s motion is that the appraisal submitted by claimant values the property solely as a fully developed 18-lot subdivision. The State asserts that the appraisal is legally in error in utilizing this developed subdivision as the appropriate “highest and best use” for valuation purposes since it assumes development of a project which could not be built.
The courts of this State, including the Court of Claims, have long held that a condemnee is entitled to the highest and best available use of the property irrespective of whether it is so used (Matter of County of Suffolk [Firester], 37 NY2d 649 [1975]; Keator v State of New York, 23 NY2d 337 [1968]; Breitenstein v State of New York, 245 AD2d 837 [1997]). However, this valuation by “highest and best use” is not unfettered and requires a determination that a development which is theoretically possible based upon zoning can actually be accomplished in view of all regulations which affect such development. The courts have held that a speculative or hypothetical “highest and best use” cannot serve as the basis for an award and there must be a reasonable probability that an asserted highest and best use would materialize in the reasonably near future (Masten v State of New York, 11 AD2d 370 [1960], affd 9 NY2d 796 [1961]; West Seneca Cent. School Dist. v State of New York, 60 AD2d 760 [1977]). Further, an indication that there is “some possibility” is insufficient and it must be established that the asserted highest and best use could or would have been made of the subject property in the near future (Matter of City of New York [Shorefront High School-Rudnick], 25 NY2d 146, 149 [1969]).
Based upon all of the documentary evidence in the record and the testimony of every witness on this issue, the following facts are clear: (1) to the extent a road existed west of the Taconic at Bogardus Lane, it never exceeded a 12-to-16-foot right-of-way; (2) to the extent such road or access easement existed, it was utilized by one individual to serve one single-family residence; (3) the Town of East Fishkill would not approvd an 18-lot subdivision where the only access was a 16-foot wide right-of-way; (4) the Town of East Fishkill requirements for a new subdivision approval include a 50-foot right-of-way as a threshold condition; (5) the DOT had no intention of approving an expansion and/or an improvement of that right-of-way to 50 feet with impervious surface and markings; (6) that claimant was aware of the DOT policy regarding access to the Taconic prior to its purchase of the property; and (7) that claimant’s expert appraiser, Donald McGrath, was also aware of all of these factors.
Based upon all of the above, it is clear to this court that although an 18-lot residential subdivision may be the ¡theoretical highest and best use of claimant’s property, there is no reasonable probability that the DOT would have allowed the improvement and expansion of the right-of-way in a manner which would gain access for 18 lots to the Taconic. In defahlt of such access, there is no reasonable probability that the Town of East Fishkill would have approved such a subdivision anywhere in the near future. Further, based upon the documentary evidence and testimony of all the witnesses, even if this court were to find that a 16-foot wide easement did exist, there would be no legal mechanism by which claimant could force the DOT to permit the expansion and overburdening of an easement which previously serviced a single residential dwelling in a manner required to service an approvable 18-lot subdivision.
On the basis of all of the above, and giving due consideration to the reasonable probabilities involved, this court finds that the valuation contained in claimant’s appraisal, which assumed solely the development of an 18-lot subdivision, was in error.
Further, had this court found that claimant possessed a compensable vested right-of-aecess, the instant appraisal! would be of no value to the court in assessing the damages to be awarded. The record is totally devoid of any evidence of valuation of the property as a single-family residential lot either before or after the 1999 “taking.”
Therefore, in view of my finding that the subdivision was speculative, at best, and the lack of any alternative information as to the value of a single-family residential lot, the court finds that the appraisal is based upon erroneous assumptions and is hereby stricken.
As the court finds there was no taking of claimant’s property, the claim must be, and is hereby, dismissed.
. This dirt and gravel lane was variously referred to at trial as Bogardus Lane, a driveway, a road or a dirt and gravel wheel track. The court will refer to it as Bogardus Lane west of the Taconic, Bogardus Lane West or the driveway. !
. Mr. McKeown was an employee of the Town of East Fishkill Highway Department from 1937 until 1975 and was Highway Supervisen from 1950 until 1975. The transcript of his deposition testimony was admitted into evidence as exhibit 15.
. It is also noted that in 1938 this court awarded damages to Mr. Garrison resulting from the 1936 appropriation. While the findings of fact in that matter did not specifically deal with issues of access, it does indicate that, at least as of 1938, the appropriation by the State had been addressed, analyzed and fully compensated by payment to Cornelius W Garrison, the record owner (see exhibit 10).
. On this issue, it is interesting to note that there is a difference in the documentary evidence as to the length of Bogardus Lane. Bogardus Lane extends either .28 or .24 miles from its origination at Old Sylvan Lake Road. No definitive evidence was submitted as to whether either of these linear dimensions ends on the east side of the Taconic, in the middle of fhe Taconic or includes the western spur, which is at issue in the case at bar. j
. Were the court to hold otherwise, it would then be necessary to consider whether the public highway had been abandoned pursuant to Highway Law § 205. Mr. Miller testified that at some undetermined point, the Town of East Fishkill ceased performing services on the right-of-way. Exactly when the cessation occurred was not in evidence. However, the court’s determination that Highway Law § 189 is inapplicable makes an analysis of section 205 unnecessary.
. It is also noted that claimant apparently filed a CPLR article 78 proceeding in relation to the instant manner. However, neither counsel ever explained to the court whether the article 78 was perfected or how it was resolved. Presumably, if the defendant could be forced to approve an expapded access, article 78 would have been the vehicle. \",0
0791-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Dennis K. McDermott, S.
Joshua W. Thayer, the decedent herein, died intestate on October 18, 2001 as the result of injuries he sustained in an automobile accident. He was 21 years old, unmarried, and survived by his parents.
Joshua’s girlfriend at the time was Bethaney Soule, then 18 years old and never married. Their relationship had become sexually intimate and, in mid-August 2001, Bethaney became pregnant. Sometime during the latter part of September, Joshua and Bethaney went to his parents’ home and, according to Bethaney, Joshua announced to them that “we [are] going to have a baby.” During the first week of October, Joshua and Bethaney made a similar visit to the home of her aunt, Stephanie Pylman, who testified, “they just stated they were having a baby.” She testified that she admonished them that they needed to grow up and take responsibility, and she recalled Joshua saying that he and Bethaney would raise the baby together. Asked by the court whether Joshua specifically said he was the father, Ms. Pylman said, “No . . . [H]e didn’t say, ‘I’m the father’ or anything like that. He just said, ‘We’ll do it together’,” and that he said, “ ‘We’re going to have a baby.’ ”
Katrina Thayer, Joshua’s mother and the administrator of his estate, testified that she recalled Joshua and Bethaney telling her that they were going to have a baby. However, she also recalled that a week or two before Joshua and Bethaney announced her pregnancy, Joshua told her and his sister that he was not sure that Bethaney was having his child but that it was possible that he was the father. He similarly acknowledged to his grandmother that he could be the father of Bethaney’s child. Thus, shortly after his death but prior to his funeral, Katrina had blood and DNA samples taken from him and preserved for future testing after the birth of the baby.
On May 5, 2002, nearly seven months after Joshua’s death, Bethaney gave birth to a girl who was named Melanie. In July, the preserved blood and DNA material from Joshua and similar material collected from Bethaney and Melanie were analyzed by an authorized and accredited clinical laboratory at the M.I. Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, New York, and the resulting DNA parentage test report showed a 99.98% probability that Joshua was Melanie’s father.
By petition dated April 17, 2003, Bethaney asks this court to determine that Joshua is Melanie’s father, thus entitling Melanie to be the sole recipient of the proceeds of a settlement in a wrongful death action. Katrina Thayer concedes that her son is Melanie’s father, and the guardian ad litem joins in the petitioner’s request for relief. Despite the parties’ unanimity, the court must be satisfied that the proof adduced is sufficient to satisfy the statute.
EPTL 4-1.2 (a) (2) provides the means by which a nonmarital child’s right to inherit from her father through intestacy may be established after the death of the alleged father. Because there had been no order of filiation made during Joshua’s lifetime and because Joshua had never signed an instrument acknowledging his paternity, the child’s right to inherit from him may be established in only two ways: (1) by clear and convincing evidence of paternity and proof that the father of the child has openly and notoriously acknowledged the child as his own (EPTL 4-1.2 [a] [2] [C]), or (2) by proof that a blood genetic marker test had been administered to that father together with other evidence establishing paternity by clear and convincing evidence (EPTL 4-1.2 [a] [2] [D]).
Interpreting the words “had been administered” (emphasis added) literally, the Appellate Division, Third Department, has held that to satisfy EPTL 4-1.2 (a) (2) (D), the blood genetic marker test must have been made during the alleged father’s lifetime so that receipt of the results of a test conducted postmortem is not authorized by the statute. (Matter of Sekanic, 229 AD2d 76 [3d Dept 1997]; see also, Matter of Janis, 210 AD2d 101 [1st Dept 1994].)
Notwithstanding that the results of a posthumously conducted blood genetic marker test are inadmissible to satisfy EPTL 4-1.2 (a) (2) (D), it has been held that such test results may satisfy the “clear and convincing evidence” component of EPTL 4-1.2 (a) (2) (C), leaving only the issue of the father’s open and notorious acknowledgment of paternity to be addressed. (Matter of Bonanno, 192 Misc 2d 86 [Sur Ct, NY County 2002]; Matter of Seekins, 194 Misc 2d 422 [Sur Ct, Westchester County 2002].)
A blood genetic marker test indicating a probability of paternity of 95% or greater creates a rebuttable presumption that the putative father tested is, in fact, the father of the child. (Family Ct Act § 532 [a].) Here, a test result of 99.98% is more than sufficient to constitute clear and convincing evidence of paternity.
Where the putative father had acknowledged his paternity to the child’s mother and to one of her friends but had admonished the friend to keep such acknowledgment a secret, the court found this to be the antithesis to open and notorious acknowledgment. (Matter of Gentile, 2002 NY Slip Op 40026[U] [Sur Ct, Nassau County 2002].) Gentile is distinguishable from the instant ease in that the “child” was 42 years old at the time of the alleged father’s death.
In this case, the child was not born until nearly seven months after the father’s death, a situation similar to that in Matter of Wilkins (184 Misc 2d 218 [Sur Ct, Niagara County 2000]). There, however, the only proof that the decedent had acknowledged his paternity had come from the child’s mother whose testimony the court found to be “suspect and self-serving.”
Here, by contrast, shortly after learning that Bethaney was pregnant, Joshua readily acknowledged to his mother, sister and grandmother that he could be the father of the child. In the few short weeks between that time and his unexpected death, he had apparently resolved whatever doubts he might have entertained and he had gone with Bethaney to his mother and to her aunt to announce that they were going to have a baby.
While one commentator has opined that “the likelihood of a decedent’s acknowledging a child still in útero is slim” (Turano, 2000 Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 17B, EPTL 4-1.2, 2003 Supp Pamph, at 43), this court is satisfied that, under the circumstances presented here, the decedent did all that he might reasonably be expected to do to openly and notoriously acknowledge that he was the father of the child that would ultimately be born to Bethaney. The preservation of his blood and DNA material appears to be the result of his mother’s doubts rather than his own.
This court finds under EPTL 4-1.2 (a) (2) (C) that the decedent openly and notoriously acknowledged that he was the father of Bethaney Soule’s unborn child and that the 99.98% probability of paternity indicated in the blood genetic marker test report constitutes clear and convincing proof of his paternity. He is, accordingly, found to be the father of Melanie Soule, born to Bethaney Soule on May 5, 2002.",0
0005-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Memorandum.
Judgment of conviction unanimously affirmed.
Defendant’s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence is unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, with respect to defendant’s contention that the evidence does not support a finding of “intent to use unlawfully against another,” it is well settled that intent may be inferred from the act itself, or “from the defendant’s conduct or the surrounding circumstances” (People v Bracey, 41 NY2d 296, 301 [internal quotation marks omitted]).
With respect to defendant’s argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, it is noted that resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the trier of fact, which saw and heard the witnesses (see People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 94 [1903]). Its determination should be accorded great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless clearly unsupported by the record (see People v Garafolo, 44 AD2d 86, 88 [1974]). Upon review of the record, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.05 [5]).
Finally, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of “necessity” (Penal Law § 35.05 [2]; see generally People v Pons, 68 NY2d 264 [1986]; People v Almodovar, 62 NY2d 126 [1984]; compare People v McManus, 67 NY2d 541 [1986]). It is well settled that the defense of justification of use of physical force (Penal Law § 35.15) is not available as a defense to a crime based upon the possession of a weapon. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has definitively stated that “because possession of a weapon does not involve the use of physical force . . . there are no circumstances when justification [under Penal Law § 35.15] . . . can be a defense to the crime of criminal possession of a weapon” (People v Pons, supra at 267).
The instant case, however, raises the issue of the applicability of the justification defense of “necessity” (Penal Law § 35.05 [2]) to the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [2]). Because the instrument in question was not a weapon per se, but rather a kitchen knife, the presumption of unlawful intent by virtue of the mere possession of the instrument (see Penal Law § 265.15 [4]) does not apply. Inasmuch as the mere possession of a kitchen knife, without more, is not unlawful, the issue in the first instance was whether the People met their burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the kitchen knife “with intent to use [it] unlawfully against another” (Penal Law § 265.01 [2]).
Inasmuch as we find that the People met their burden, we hold that the defense of “necessity” is thereby rendered inapplicable. We cannot conceive of a situation where an intent to use a kitchen knife unlawfully can ever be justified. Since intent to use unlawfully is one of the elements that the People have to establish, should the People fail to meet their burden of proving that element beyond a reasonable doubt, the charge of unlawful possession will not have been proven, and the issue of justification, by virtue of that failure of proof, will never be reached.
It should also be noted that in People v Abdul-Hakeem (172 AD2d 177 [1991]), the First Department, following the rationale of People v Almodovar (supra) and People v Pons (supra) found the defense of “necessity” (Penal Law § 35.05 [2]) inapplicable to weapons offenses.
Although defendant would limit the application of People v Almodovar (supra) and People v Pons (supra) to cases where the weapon possessed is a per se weapon, there is nothing in the case law to suggest that such a limitation is warranted (see e.g. People v Tomback, 244 AD2d 586 [1997] [possession of a baseball bat]; People v Cosby, 200 AD2d 682 [1994] [possession of a wrench]; see also People v Campbell, 2003 NY Slip Op 50688[U] [App Term, 1st Dept] [possession of a brick]).

0279-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Raymond E. Cornelius, J.
Pursuant to an application of Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., this court signed an order, dated June 17, 2003, directing the plaintiff, Paul Armstrong, to show cause why an order should not be made and entered, under CPLR 321 (b) (2), permitting the law firm to withdraw as attorneys of record. The attorney’s affirmation submitted in support of the application cited unspecified “disagreements,” which, if requested, would be disclosed to the court, in camera, and as a consequence, asserted that the law office and plaintiff could “no longer enjoy a good working relationship which is necessary between attorney and client.” In addition, the affirmation requested that the court fix a lien upon any future recovery made in the action in favor of Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., and that the action be stayed for 30 days, following service of an order relieving the law firm as counsel, in order to permit plaintiff to obtain another attorney.
As indicated by the index number, this action had been commenced in 2001, by filing the summons and complaint in the Yates County Clerk’s office. In this lawsuit, Mr. Armstrong, who is a Yates County resident, had sought money damages, based upon a claim of personal injury as the result of exposure to asbestos products, manufactured or distributed by 84 corporate defendants. Following service of process, and pursuant to the provisions of 22 NYCRR 202.12 (a), counsel for the plaintiff made an application for a preliminary conference, which was held on March 11, 2002. At that time, the court directed that the trial commence on a day certain, to wit: July 14, 2003, and that the note of issue and certificate of readiness be filed at least 60 days prior thereto, which directives were then incorporated in a written order, dated March 26, 2002. Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff and liaison counsel for the defendants agreed upon a detailed scheduling order, which was incorporated into another written order, dated May 8, 2002, directing, among other provisions, that the deposition of the plaintiff was to occur on or before December 20, 2002. Until very recently, the court was unaware that, because of health problems, there was no deposition taken from Mr. Armstrong.
The note of issue and certificate of readiness was not filed, as required by the aforementioned scheduling order, and on June 4, 2003, this court wrote to counsel for the plaintiff, with a copy to liaison counsel, making inquiry concerning the reason. Thereafter, the court was informed that counsel wished to withdraw as attorney of record for Mr. Armstrong, and, ultimately, was provided with the aforementioned application, consisting of a proposed order to show cause, together with the attorney’s affirmation. On July 3, 2003, Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., forwarded to the court a conformed copy of the order to show cause, affidavit verifying personal service upon Mr. Armstrong, and copies of two letters, sent to their client. One letter, dated June 26, 2003, recited that there had been multiple telephone conversations with Mr. Armstrong and his wife, during the past six months, including one the morning of June 26, 2003, during which Mr. Armstrong purportedly indicated his wish to discontinue the lawsuit. The letter also made reference to the second letter, dated January 9, 2003, which confirmed a telephone conversation, on January 8, 2003, during which Mr. Armstrong purportedly indicated that he did not wish to pursue compensation for his asbestos related condition. This letter informed Mr. Armstrong that, as the result of his decision, Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., was closing their file and would take no further action with regard to it. Further, in this correspondence, Mr. Armstrong was advised that he was free to consult with another attorney. Neither the court, nor presumably defense counsel, had previously been aware of the January 9, 2003 letter, or the fact that Weitz & Luxenberg, EC. had decided to close their file and take no further action in this case.
On July 7, 2003, counsel for the plaintiff was advised that the decision on the application to withdraw as counsel would be made following oral argument, and that if the plaintiff was unable to personally appear in Rochester on the return date, the court was prepared to hear the motion in the county of plaintiffs residence. In response, counsel informed the court the plaintiff was unable to travel because of health reasons, questioned the necessity of oral argument because the plaintiff wished to dismiss his case, and asserted that the application for permission to withdraw as counsel was a matter between Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., the plaintiff, and the court.
On July 8, 2003, the court sent a letter to plaintiffs counsel, with a copy again to liaison counsel, and cited CPLR 321 (b) (2), which provides that an attorney of record may be withdrawn or changed by order of the court, but only upon such notice to the client and the other parties in the action, or their respective counsel, as may be directed by the court. The order to show cause, submitted by plaintiffs counsel in this case, provided for service not only upon the plaintiff, but all defendants, or their respective attorneys of record. Accordingly, the court disagreed with the proposition that this was a matter simply between Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., the plaintiff and the court. Further, in this same letter, reference was made to the Code of Erofessional Responsibility (EC 2-31, 2-32), and indicated that there may be some ethical questions concerning abandonment of the case, based upon counsel’s letter to their client, dated January 9, 2003.
The initial return date for the order to show cause in Rochester, New York, was July 10, 2003. In addition, several defendants, Weil-McLain, a division of The Marley Company, and Fulton Boiler Works, Inc., had made motions for summary judgment returnable on the same date. Counsel for Weil-McLain also formally opposed the application by Weitz & Luxenberg, EC. for permission to be relieved as counsel of record and for a 30-day stay in order to permit the plaintiff to retain other counsel. On July 10, 2003, all matters were adjourned at the request of counsel for the plaintiff to July 14, 2003, in Fenn Yan, New York, in order to permit the personal appearance of Mr. Armstrong.
On the adjourned date of July 14, 2003, Mr. Armstrong and his wife, together with two attorneys from Weitz & Luxenberg, P.C., appeared at the Yates County Courthouse, along with counsel representing several defendants. One of the attorneys appearing on behalf of Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., was the attorney who had signed the affirmation in support of the application to withdraw as counsel. He explained that the request for a 30-day stay had been made in error, and represented that, instead, and in addition to the application to withdraw as counsel, there should have been a motion to discontinue the action because Mr. Armstrong did not wish to pursue the lawsuit. He also disclosed, for the first time, that at the time of the January 9, 2003 letter sent to Mr. Armstrong, there had been ongoing settlement negotiations with certain defendants. In fact, settlements had been subsequently reached with three defendants for a total of $10,000 to be paid to the plaintiff. Furthermore, counsel indicated that an agreement had been reached with Mr. Armstrong, that very morning, to continue to process claims involving defendants who filed for bankruptcy protection. It should also be mentioned that between the time of the January 9, 2003 letter and the appearance on July 14, 2003, Weitz & Luxenberg, EC. had signed stipulations of discontinuance on behalf of Mr. Armstrong. In some instances, these stipulations had been submitted to the court and formed the basis for orders of dismissal in regard to certain defendants. On other occasions, orders of dismissal were submitted to and signed by the court, based upon the lack of product or workplace identification, pursuant to an expedited procedure contained in the Seventh Judicial District Asbestos Litigation case management order.
Mr. Armstrong, who is 83 years of age and was apparently using a portable oxygen tank, was accompanied to court by his wife. Mrs. Armstrong related, that approximately three years ago, her husband had taken advantage of screening in Rochester, New York, offered by Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., and as the result of asbestosis being discovered, this law firm now represented him. There apparently had been telephone conversations, during the interim, but Mr. Armstrong stated that the morning of July 14, 2003 was the first time he had met the attorneys appearing on his behalf. He was also unaware of the settlements reached with three of the defendants, and had not received any of the proceeds. In essence, Mr. Armstrong indicated to the court that he was experiencing health problems, he was not interested in pursuing the lawsuit further, and had no objection to Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., being relieved as counsel of record.
Under the Code of Professional Responsibility, if permission for withdrawal from employment is required by the rules of a tribunal, an attorney may not withdraw from such employment or in a case before that tribunal, without its permission. (Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-110 [a] [1] [22 NYCRR 1200.15 (a) (1)].) Unless a consent to change attorneys is filed with the clerk of the court, together with notice to all parties or their respective counsel, the State of New York only permits an attorney of record to withdraw or to be changed by order of the court, in which the action is pending, upon motion and notice to the client and the other parties on such notice as the court may direct. (CPLR 321 [b] [1], [2].) Thus, absent the filing of a stipulation, an attorney’s authority to act on behalf of a client continues until such time as the attorney is removed by court order. (Blondell v Malone, 91 AD2d 1201 [4th Dept 1983].) The policy, underlying this rule, has been stated as follows:
“Hornbook law provides that a client may discharge his or her attorney at any time with or without cause. Likewise, an attorney may have good and sufficient reasons to seek withdrawal from representing the client. When a change of attorneys occurs during the course of an action, however, the judicial system’s interest in procedural regularity and fairness to other parties requires certainty as to the point in time at which a party’s change of counsel should be deemed effective.” (Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C321:2.)
It has been determined that the mere delivery of a letter from a client to an attorney was ineffective to discharge the attorney and thereby validate subsequent agreements solely between the client and other parties to a lawsuit. (Moustakas v Bouloukos, 112 AD2d 981 [2d Dept 1985].) In this court’s opinion, the delivery of the letter of January 9, 2003 to Mr. Armstrong, wherein Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., stated that they would be closing their file and would take no further action, was, likewise, ineffective to discharge them as attorney of record in this case. At no time had a consent to change attorney been filed, as contemplated by CPLR 321 (b) (1), and accordingly, the only means by which Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., may be permitted to withdraw as attorney of record is by court order, pursuant to CPLR 321 (b) (2). If this court were to rule otherwise, such action may well invalidate the aforementioned stipulations of discontinuance, orders of dismissal and settlements reached on behalf of Mr. Armstrong.
Generally, an attorney should be permitted to withdraw as attorney of record for good and sufficient reason. However, a party’s desire to discontinue their action, because of health or other reasons, even if the attorney wishes to pursue the lawsuit, should not constitute the type of disagreement to form a basis for an order of dismissal, under CPLR 321 (b) (2) as alleged in the attorney’s affirmation in this case. Furthermore, notwithstanding Mr. Armstrong’s purported desire to discontinue his lawsuit, as memorialized in counsel’s letter of January 9, 2003, it appears that Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., has continued to undertake representation on Mr. Armstrong’s behalf. These actions include settlement agreements reached with certain defendants, which, unfortunately, have not been discussed with Mr. Armstrong, nor have the net proceeds been disbursed to him. Under circumstances where, as here, an attorney undertakes certain actions on behalf of a client, but fails to perform all of the duties required of the attorney/client relationship, a motion, under CPLR 321 (b) (2), should be denied. In this court’s opinion, such result is dictated, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Armstrong has not opposed the application of Weitz & Luxenberg, PC., to withdraw as counsel of record. As stated by the Court of Appeals, many years ago, the relationship between an attorney and client is of an unusual character, and “the elements of trust and confidence on the part of the client and of undivided loyalty and devotion on the part of the attorney” require “that the courts by virtue of their inherent power over attorneys compel by summary and rigorous proceedings their fulfillment of obligations springing out of the relationship . . . .” (Matter of Dunn, 205 NY 398, 402 [1912].) The pending matter is a fairly typical, asbestos related personal injury action, involving commencement of the lawsuit against multiple defendants, intervening bankruptcies of some, and settlement with a few, oftentimes as part of group settlements and ultimate dismissal against most defendants. However, this fact should not alter the court’s responsibility to ensure that counsel meets the requisite standard in discharging their duties.
Finally, in addition to the foregoing, the motion for permission to withdraw as counsel of record for the plaintiff should be denied, at this time, for another reason. As aforementioned, Mrs. Armstrong represented that her husband did not sign anything at the time Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., began to represent him. It is significant that counsel sent a letter to the court, following the appearance on July 14, 2003, which he requested be made part of the record, and although he disputed his client’s assertion that he had failed to return telephone calls, did not address the question of whether or not there existed a signed retainer agreement.
Currently, with certain limited exceptions, an attorney who undertakes to represent a client, in the State of New York, and enters into an agreement for any fee, must provide the client with a written letter of engagement, or alternatively, by entering into a written retainer agreement with the client. (22 NYCRR 1215.1.) At the time this action was commenced, the rules of practice within the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, required every attorney, who entered into a contingency fee arrangement with a client, residing in the Fourth Department, involving a personal injury action, to file a written statement, containing specified information, with the Office of Court Administration within 30 days of such retainer or agreement. (22 NYCRR 1022.2.) Following an inquiry made to the Office of Court Administration to ascertain whether or not there had been compliance with the filing requirements of 22 NYCRR 1022.2, this court was advised that, as of October 2002, the records fail to. disclose any statement filed by Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., on behalf of the plaintiff. Until this matter is otherwise resolved, the motion by Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., to withdraw as attorney of record should be denied.
Based upon the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered that the motion of Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., to withdraw as attorney of record for the plaintiff, Faul Armstrong, is denied, with costs to the defendant, Weil-McLain, a division of The Marley Company, and costs and disbursements incurred by Weitz & Luxenberg, EC., in connection with their motion not to be charged, to their client, and it is further ordered that the motion for summary judgment made on behalf of the defendants, Weil-McLain, a division of The Marley Company, and Fulton Boiler Works, Inc., is granted, and the complaint is dismissed as to those defendants, and it is further ordered that the motion of the plaintiff that the action be discontinued against all remaining defendants, pursuant to CFLR 3217 (b), is granted and the complaint is dismissed, with prejudice, against all remaining defendants, with the exception of the defendants, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, North American Refractories Company (NARCO), and Union Carbide, and it is further ordered that as to the defendant, NARCO, all further actions are stayed pending order of the Bankruptcy Court.
. In addition to this action, counsel for the plaintiff also filed four similar actions in the Yates County Clerk’s office, at the same time, involving all or most of the same defendants. (Alderman, No. 01-293, Brundage, No. 01-292, Jones, No. 01-290, and Mickelson, No. 01-289.)
. The Seventh Judicial District Asbestos Litigation case management order provides that all pretrial matters be heard in Rochester, New York, the county seat of Monroe County, which is approximately 53 miles from Penn Yan, New York, the county seat of Yates County.
. This rule became effective March 4, 2002.
. Pursuant to amendment, effective May 28, 2003, 22 NYCRR 1022.2 has now been repealed.
. The Office of Court Administration records also fail to disclose statements in the four other similar actions, filed in Yates County, at the same time.
. “[Section] 1022.17 Professional misconduct defined. A violation of any rule of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility as set forth in Part 1200 of this Title, or any other rule or announced standard of the Appellate Division governing the conduct of attorneys, shall constitute professional misconduct within the meaning of Judiciary Law, section 90 (2).”",0

Frank J. LaBuda, J.
This matter comes on by letter/motion of defendant that statements made by the alleged victim, three-year-old Samantha Doe, to her mother directly after the alleged sexual abuse are hearsay and inadmissible.
The prosecution is prepared, does not intend on calling the child as an unsworn witness, but will use the mother’s testimony of the child’s “recent complaint” under hearsay "" exceptions or res gestae and/or prompt outcry.
Statement of Facts
The defendant, Bobbie G. Potter, Sr. is charged by Indictment No. 164-02 with sexual abuse in the first degree and endangering the welfare of a child. On or about January 25, 2002, the defendant allegedly sexually abused a three-year-old female, Samantha Doe, at her mother’s residence in Ulster County.
On or about January 25, 2002 the defendant visited the home of Barbara Doe and her children at 157 Glenerie Boulevard in the Town of Saugerties, Ulster County, New York. Ms. Doe, who was just returning from work, fed her children supper and dressed the three-year-old for bed in her underwear, pajama top and pajama bottom. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Doe told the defendant to leave because she was tired and needed to go to bed; however, Ms. Doe fell asleep on the couch and did not awake until the three-year-old victim woke her up later that night. Ms. Doe did not notice when the defendant had left the home. Ms. Doe did notice, however, that the chimes usually attached to her door, and which she noticed were there when she returned from work, were no longer hanging from the door.
Later that night, when Samantha Doe woke her mother, Ms. Doe noticed that the child was cold to the touch and not wearing the pajama pants she had dressed her in before putting her to bed. When Ms. Doe asked the child why she was not wearing her pajama pants, the child responded that the defendant took her out of the house, into a car and touched her in her private area, and pointed to the vaginal area. During that response, the victim pointed to her vagina. Later that day, Ms. Doe took her to the doctor and reported the matter to the police. There was no physical injury to the child noted by the examining doctor.
There is no question that the alleged victim’s statements to her mother were made immediately after the alleged sexual abuse. Thus, said statements to the mother are a “prompt outcry” of the victim.
The law in the State of New York is clear that evidence from either the victim, or any witness who heard the victim, is admissible concerning the prompt complaint or outcry of sexual abuse. (Prince, Richardson on Evidence § 8-615, at 652 [Farrell 11th ed]; People v McDaniel, 81 NY2d 10 [1993].)
“In this state, evidence that a victim of sexual assault promptly complained about the incident is admissible to corroborate the allegation that an assault took place (see, People v Rice, 75 NY2d 929, 931 [1990]; People v Deitsch, 237 NY 300, 304 [1923]; People v O’Sullivan, 104 NY, at 486-487; Richardson, Evidence § 292 [Prince 10th ed]). Historically, the doctrine evolved from the common-law requirement of ‘hue and cry,’ where all victims were required to prove they immediately alerted the community that a crime had occurred (State v Hill, 121 NJ 150, 157, 578 A2d 370, 374 [1990]; Note, A Matter of Time: Evidence of a Victim’s Prompt Complaint in New York, 53 Brooklyn L Rev 1087, 1089 [1988]).” (People v McDaniel, supra at 16.)
Prompt outcry is admissible as an exception to what would otherwise be hearsay but testimony concerning the statement must be a concise and accurate representation which does not convey any details except those necessary to elicit the nature of the complaint. (People v McDaniel, supra; People v Green, 298 AD2d 209 [1st Dept 2002].)
Additionally, the statement to the mother is part of the res gestae of the instant matter under the immediate circumstances as the child presented to the mother that morning. (People v Vicaretti, 54 AD2d 236 [4th Dept 1976].)
Thus, the mother cannot testify to any of the details of the touching since the courts have uniformly held that only the “fact of the complaint, not its details is admissible.” (People v Rice, 75 NY2d 929, 932 [1990].)
However, the defense contends that even if the daughter’s statements are prompt outcry it is still inadmissible because the “outcry” is from an incompetent declarant; i.e., a three year old who could not provide either sworn or unsworn testimony. But, the prompt outcry is not a statement going to the truth of the matter. It is simply a showing that a prompt outcry was made.
Based upon the above, it is ordered that the “prompt outcry” of the alleged victim to her mother is admissible, as to the concise and accurate statement of said outcry without unnecessary detail.
. The name of the victim is being withheld from publication by the court.
. Indeed, the Assistant District Attorney at this juncture, prior to trial, has indicated to counsel and this court that he doesn’t intend to call the three year old (now four), as a witness.",0

Memorandum.
Order unanimously modified by providing that the petition is granted insofar as it sought to vacate the arbitrator’s award and matter remanded for arbitration before a different arbitrator; as so modified, affirmed without costs.
Pursuant to the mandatory arbitration provisions of Insurance Law § 5105, petitioner Allcity Insurance Company as subrogee of Jane Thomas (Allcity) filed a demand for arbitration on March 1, 1999 seeking reimbursement of no-fault payments it made to its subrogor by checks dated February 5, 1997. Arbitration Forums Inc. twice denied the claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired. Allcity commenced a special proceeding to vacate the arbitrator’s award. By order entered October 30, 2000, the court below granted Allcity’s first petition and remanded the matter for a new hearing. Allcity sought arbitration for a second time and, following the hearing, Arbitration Forums Inc. again dismissed the claim on the aforementioned statute of limitations ground. Allcity then filed the instant petition to vacate the February 2002 arbitrator’s award, and sought sanctions against Arbitration Forums Inc. By order entered August 7, 2002, the court denied Allcity’s second petition, finding that it was not based on one of the limited grounds upon which such an award may be vacated pursuant to CPLR 7511 and that the arbitrator applied the correct statute of limitations.
The Civil Court determined, upon granting Allcity’s first petition and remanding the matter for arbitration, that the arbitrator’s award dismissing the claim as barred by the statute of limitations was not based on the evidence and that it was arbitrary and capricious for the arbitrator to dismiss the claim since Allcity timely made its demand for arbitration within three years of its first no-fault payment (see CPLR 214 [2]; Matter of Motor Veh. Acc. Indem. Corp. v Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 89 NY2d 214 [1996]; Aetna Life & Cas. Co. v Nelson, 67 NY2d 169, 175 [1986]; Matter of Budget Rent-A-Car [State Ins. Fund], 237 AD2d 153 [1997]; Allcity Ins. Co. v American Tr. Ins. Co., NYLJ, Feb. 8, 2000, at 28, col 3 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]).
Upon a review of the record, we agree with the October 30, 2000 determination of the court below and note that inasmuch as the parties had a “full and fair” opportunity to litigate this issue, said determination constituted the law of the case and the August 2002 order of the court below erroneously fails to abide by same (see People v Evans, 94 NY2d 499 [2000], rearg denied 96 NY2d 755 [2001]). Moreover, in Matter of Motor Veh. Acc. Indem. Corp. v Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. (89 NY2d 214 [1996], supra), the Court of Appeals determined that closer judicial scrutiny is required, and the arbitrary and capricious standard is applicable, if arbitration is compulsory pursuant to a statutory mandate (id. at 223). To the extent that the Fourth Department case, Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. v Clarendon Natl. Ins. Co. (259 AD2d 971 [1999]), is inconsistent with the Court of Appeals’ holding in Matter of Motor Veh. Acc. Indem. Corp. v Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. (supra), it is not controlling.
Furthermore, although we deem the issue concerning the implicit denial by the court below of that branch of Allcity’s petition seeking the imposition of sanctions against Arbitration Forums Inc. abandoned since Allcity did not raise said issue in its appellate brief (see Baliva v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 286 AD2d 953, 955 [2001]), we are disturbed by Arbitration Forums Inc.’s, and its administrator’s, willful disregard of a lawful court order.

Michael V Ajello, J.
This is a CPLR article 78 proceeding brought against Gregory Serio, the Superintendent of Insurance, and IPRO, an external appeal agent which reviews, pursuant to article 49 of the Insurance Law, determinations of health care plans to deny coverage for medical treatment to their insureds. The proceeding has been severed and dismissed as to the Superintendent of Insurance.
According to Dr. Jonathan L. Finlay, Director of the Adult and Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Program at the New York University Cancer Center, petitioner was initially diagnosed in September 1996 with a large left frontal lobe tumor. She underwent radical surgical resection and the tumor was found to be a low grade mixed oligo-astrocytoma. Petitioner experienced a stroke postoperatively, suffering a right hemiparesis and speech difficulties as well as short-term memory problems, all of which still persist. Petitioner was referred to Dr. Finlay by her neurosurgeon because a follow-up MRI demonstrated a small recurrence of the tumor. Petitioner underwent surgical resection of the tumor and it was found to have transformed into a malignant mixed oligo-astrocytoma.
Dr. Finlay treated petitioner with two courses of the oral anticancer drug temozolomide over a four-month period, with no evidence of any regrowth of the tumor. Petitioner remains in a state of minimal tumor burden, which is the optimal situation for seeking definitive curative treatment with high dose chemotherapy.
The treatment Dr. Finlay proposed was a single course of high dose chemotherapy followed by rescue with petitioner’s own, previously harvested and preserved, peripheral blood precursor cells. The drugs Dr. Finlay intended to use were thiotepa, carboplatin and temozolomide, all of which are known to be active and effective in producing responses in patients with the type of tumor which petitioner has. Dr. Finlay indicated that the only alternative treatment involves radiation therapy to petitioner’s brain, which offers patients with malignant mixed gliomas no better than a 40% chance of cure, either administered alone or with the addition of standard dose chemotherapy. Dr. Finlay further indicated that a crucial aspect of the proposed treatment was the avoidance of irradiation to an extensive area of petitioner’s left dominant hemisphere and right frontal regions since it would have a debilitating effect on her, likely resulting in serious and permanent intellectual and psychosocial deterioration.
The proposed treatment for petitioner was part of a clinical trial. Dr. Finlay stated that although it is a phase I trial, all of the chemical agents used have been well studied and the only aspect of this study that makes it a phase I study is an evaluation of the use of increasing doses of temozolomide in addition to thiotepa and carboplatin. The stem cell rescue is to provide “rescue” from the high doses of chemotherapy that the trial is utilizing and which he believed would have a high likelihood of effectively killing petitioner’s brain cancer.
Dr. Finlay expressed the opinion that the chemotherapy would kill all remaining cancerous cells and the utilization of stem cell rescue would allow the use of levels of anticancer drugs necessary to effectively eliminate petitioner’s cancer. Furthermore, the use of marrow ablative chemotherapy with autologous hemopoietic stem cell rescue will eliminate the significant debilitating cognitive, intellectual and psychological difficulties that result from irradiation.
Petitioner’s health care plan, Group Health Insurance (GHI), denied coverage upon the ground that the treatment is part of an experimental program which has no supporting data to demonstrate that the proposed intervention will be any more effective than radiotherapy and chemotherapy at doses that do not require stem cell therapy. That determination was appealed to GHI, which submitted the matter to a GHI clinical peer reviewer, and a determination was made to uphold the nonauthorization of treatment. The reason given was that there was limited data on the treatment and that most of the available information suggests significant neurotoxicity for some of the regimes which employ high dose therapy for the treatment of gliomas and the lack of randomized controlled trials and long-term outcome data makes the treatment experimental.
Following the second denial by GHI, an external appeal was taken pursuant to the right established by section 4910 of the Insurance Law. The matter was randomly assigned to IPRO to conduct an external appeal, which in turn assigned three clinical peer reviewers to review the case.
In the initial review by the clinical peer reviewers, two stated that the determination of GHI to deny authorization should be upheld, and one reviewer concluded that GHI’s determination should be reversed. When it was discovered that the reviewers had used the wrong standard in arriving at their decisions, the matter was resubmitted to them in order that they apply the standard to be used for clinical trials. Again, two of the reviewers concluded that GHI’s determination should be upheld and one concluded that the insurance carrier’s denial of authorization should be reversed.
After IPRO notified petitioner that the denial of authorization for the treatment should be upheld because two of the three clinical peer reviewers found that the clinical trial is not likely to be a benefit to the patient, this article 78 proceeding was instituted. Both the Superintendent of Insurance and IPRO moved to dismiss the proceeding. The motion of IPRO was denied and IPRO was directed to serve an answer. The motion by the Superintendent of Insurance was granted inasmuch as the ultimate determination on an external appeal is that of the external appeal agent and the Superintendent of Insurance is not granted any power to review or in any way alter that determination. Thus, there was nothing which the Superintendent of Insurance had done or had failed to do which could be reviewed by this court.
In its answer to the petition, two defenses were raised by IPRO. The first, basically, is that there had been no showing that the procedure will likely benefit petitioner and that IPRO’s decision was well founded in that it had a rational basis.
The second defense is that the determination of the majority of the external reviewers is binding on the insured (Insurance Law § 4914 [b] [4] [B] [iv]).
Considering first the defense that the determination of the reviewers is final, thus requiring a dismissal of the petition, I find that it has no merit. While, as respondent IPRO alleges, section 4914 (b) (4) (B) (iv) does state that the determination of the external appeal agent is binding on the insured (as well as the plan), the rights and remedies conferred in article 49 upon insureds and health care providers are cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other rights or remedies available under the law (Insurance Law § 4907), and insureds and health providers are entitled to pursue all of their legal rights and remedies regardless of whether or not they have sought and obtained an external appeal (Nenno v Blue Cross & Blue Shield of W. N.Y., 303 AD2d 930 [2003], rearg denied 306 AD2d 960 [2003]).
The provision making the external appeal agent’s determination binding must be construed to mean that it marks the end of any administrative appeal, inasmuch as there is no one, including the Superintendent of Insurance, empowered to conduct a further review, but that it does not bar a review of the determination by a court.
In reaching this conclusion, I am mindful of the message by Governor George E. Pataki in approving the amendments to article 49 of the Insurance Law (as well as to the Public Health Law), referred to in this court’s denial of IPRO’s motion to dismiss. The Governor stated that the bill demonstrates that New York is continuing to lead the nation in protecting the rights and health of its residents (Governor’s Mem approving L 1998, ch 586, 1998 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 1480). This end would not be reached if this court were to adopt IPRO’s reasoning that a review by way of an article 78 proceeding was unavailable since it would relegate insureds to a time-consuming action against their health care plans, and time is a luxury that many of them do not have. Such a holding could effectively deprive them of medical treatment which would be beneficial or even life saving, and would frustrate the intent of the legislation.
This brings us to consideration of the individual determinations of the three clinical peer reviewers and the standard to be applied in arriving at the determination. For appeals taken under subdivision (b) (2) of section 4910 of the Insurance Law, such as is the case here, in order to arrive at a determination that the health care plan must pay for the treatment, the reviewers must conclude that the proposed health service or treatment is likely to be more beneficial than any standard treatment or, in the case of a clinical trial, that the treatment is likely to benefit the insured in the treatment of his or her condition (Insurance Law § 4914 [b] [4] [B] [ii] [a]).
The first clinical peer reviewer, in his initial determination to uphold GHI’s denial of authorization, based on the wrong standard that the treatment is likely to be more beneficial than any standard treatment, stated that there is no scientific data to suggest that the proposed treatment was likely to be more beneficial. He pointed out that there is no significant survival advantage since the trials are nonrandomized. He further stated that avoidance of radiotherapy for its potential neurotoxicity in this patient may be a valid point.
Upon a further review based upon the clinical trial standard, he stated that while the treatment may be a benefit to the extent that temozolomide, carboplatin and thiotepa all have activity in brain tumors and the patient may benefit from these drugs, they constitute only a portion of the treatment protocol and there is no data to support the argument that the patient would benefit from the stem cell rescue.
However, the reviewer does not mention the claim by Dr. Fin-lay that cell rescue is to provide “rescue” from the high doses of chemotherapy that the trial is utilizing. Considering this reviewer found that avoidance of radiotherapy for this patient may be a valid point and that petitioner may benefit from the use of temozolomide, carboplatin and thiotepa, combined with his failure to discuss the rescue of the stem cells required by the high doses of chemotherapy, it would appear that the reviewer actually found that the treatment would likely be a benefit to petitioner.
As to the second reviewer, he stated upon his second review that avoidance of radiotherapy for its neurotoxicity may be a valid point. However, he determined that GHI’s determination should be upheld because the long-term sequelae of high dose therapy is unknown. In so holding, the reviewer appears to be applying a standard that the ultimate result would be beneficial to the patient. Such a standard would result in ruling out practically all clinical trials. Considering his statement on the avoidance of radiotherapy, the reviewer must also be deemed to have concluded that petitioner was likely to benefit from the treatment.
The third reviewer concluded that high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue will allow for higher doses of chemotherapy to pass the blood-brain barrier and therefore result in a better outcome with regard to treatment and toxicity. He felt this was the best available treatment for petitioner and would reverse GHI’s denial.
Based on the above, I would conclude that GHI’s determination should not be sustained. However, even if the statements of the first two reviewers concerning the avoidance of radiotherapy and the use of temozolomide, carboplatin and thiotepa are not to be construed as findings on their parts that petitioner would be likely to benefit from the treatment, I still find that GHI’s decision cannot be sustained. An examination of the first reviewer’s report indicates that although on the second review he stated that he “cannot say that the patient is likely to benefit from participation in this clinical trial,” he also initially stated that the “patient appears to be eligible for the clinical trial, but I cannot judge whether she will benefit [from] the proposed therapy.” His statements, based upon the same documentation, are inconsistent as to whether petitioner would benefit from the clinical trial and this reviewer’s determination should not be considered as being either in favor of GHI’s determination or against it. This leaves only two reviewers, one in favor of the treatment and one against it and section 4914 (b) (4) (B) (a) of the Insurance Law provides that the patient costs of the proposed health service shall be covered when a reviewing panel is evenly divided as to a determination concerning coverage of the health service.
Accordingly, the determination of respondent IPRO upholding the denial of coverage to petitioner by Group Health Insurance is vacated and annulled and it is determined that the patient costs of the proposed treatment shall be covered by Group Health Insurance subject to the terms and conditions generally applicable to benefits under the evidence of coverage under the health care plan, but excluding the costs of any investigational drugs or devices themselves, the cost of any nonhealth services that may be required for petitioner to receive the treatment, the costs of managing the research, or costs which would not be covered under the policy for noninvestigational treatments.",0
0510-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Robert W. Doyle, J.
Before the court is an application by the District Attorney of Suffolk County to compel certain witnesses before a grand jury to answer questions propounded of them. The grand jury, which was empaneled by this court on June 17, 2003, is investigating the murder of an individual in East Hampton, New York. The witnesses, both of whom are attorneys representing individuals allegedly connected to the events surrounding the homicide, have asserted, on behalf of their clients, that the answers to the questions posed to them are protected from disclosure based upon attorney-client privilege and the fact that the information is attorney work product.
In pursuing the particular line of questioning before the grand jury, the Assistant District Attorney presenting this case was seeking information as to the whereabouts of a certain laptop computer, which she believes can provide critical evidence for the grand jury. This laptop computer had direct access to a video security and surveillance system, an Ademco Rapid Eye digital video system, that had been installed in the residence of the homicide victim. In support of her application, the Assistant District Attorney has set forth evidence which establishes that during the time period in which it is believed that the homicide took place, the laptop computer in question did, in fact, access the video security system. Thus the evidence suggests that this laptop computer could have assisted the perpetrator in the commission of the homicide by turning off the security system at that critical period of time and allowing the perpetrator unfettered access to the residence. The District Attorney contends that this laptop computer is to be considered an instrumentality of the crime. At the very least, the District Attorney asserts that the laptop computer provides evidence, including possible video images of the inside of the victim’s residence, which is critical to the grand jury in their investigation of the murder.
In examining the issues raised by the parties, it is important to consider that a grand jury derives its power from New York Constitution, article I, § 6 and the laws of New York (CPL 190.05 et seq.) and is deeply rooted as an institution within our system of justice. The grand jury serves as an arm of the court and not of the prosecutor (CPL 190.05; see also, Bellacosa, Practice Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 190.05, at 185), and has as its primary function to investigate crimes and to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to accuse an individual of a crime (Matter of Additional Jan. 1979 Grand Jury of Albany Supreme Ct. v Doe, 50 NY2d 14, 19 [1980]). Since no individual may be prosecuted for a felony without his or her consent except upon an indictment by a grand jury, it has been said that “the Grand Jury plays a fundamental role in the administration of our criminal justice system” (People v Doe, 84 AD2d 182, 195 [1981]). To fulfill its investigatory function, the grand jury possesses broad powers whose scope cannot be limited (see, People v Stern, 3 NY2d 658 [1958]; People ex rel. Livingston v Wyatt, 186 NY 383 [1906]). Thus, it has been held that constitutional and statutory rights of the individual must sometimes yield to a grand jury’s search for evidence (Matter of New York State Tax Commn. v State Organized Crime Task Force, 89 Misc 2d 275, 277 [1977] [and citations within]; see Virag v Hynes, 54 NY2d 437, 443 [1981]; People v Doe, 84 AD2d 182 [1981]).
As an investigatory body with broad exploratory powers, the scope of a grand jury investigation is not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts concerning whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime (Matter of Kuriansky v Seewald, 148 AD2d 238 [1989]). The broad power of the grand jury is designed to protect citizens from unfair charges and, in that capacity, it can summon people suspected of crimes or people who “may be able to provide links in a chain of evidence relating to criminal conduct of others” (United States v Mandujano, 425 US 564, 573 [1976]; Costello v United States, 350 US 359, 362 [1956]; In re Grand Jury Subpoena Served Upon Doe, 781 F2d 238 [1986], cert denied 475 US 1108 [1986]). In other words, the grand jury has a dual function: to determine if a crime has been committed under appropriate legal standards and to protect citizens against unfounded criminal charges (Branzburg v Hayes, 408 US 665, 686-687 [1972]).
Although the powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the long-standing principle that “the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,” except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege (United States v Bryan, 339 US 323, 331 [1950]; Blackmer v United States, 284 US 421, 438 [1932]; 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2192 [McNaughton rev 1961]), is applicable to grand jury proceedings. However, the grand jury’s power in the gathering of relevant evidence is not unlimited and it must exercise its broad investigatory powers “in accordance with the procedural and evidentiary rules laid down in the Criminal Procedure Law and other statutes” (Matter of New York State Dept. of Taxation & Fin. v New York State Dept. of Law, Statewide Organized Crime Task Force, 44 NY2d 575, 582 [1978]). Indeed, CPL 190.30 (1) provides that the rules of evidence governing criminal proceedings in general are applicable to grand jury proceedings.
Here, the witnesses have asserted, inter alia, that the questions propounded by the District Attorney would require disclosure of information that is protected by attorney-client privilege.
The attorney-client privilege is codified in CPLR 4503 (a). The privilege exists to insure that one seeking legal advice will be able to confide fully and freely in his or her attorney, secure in the knowledge that any confidences will not later be exposed to public view. This privilege, however, is not limitless (see, Priest v Hennessy, 51 NY2d 62, 67-68 [1980]; see also, Hoopes v Carota, 74 NY2d 716 [1989]; Matter of Jacqueline F., 47 NY2d 215 [1979]). CPLR 4503 (a) provides that
“Unless the client waives the privilege, an attorney or his employee, or any person who obtains without the knowledge of the client evidence of a confidential communication made between the attorney or his employee and the client in the course of professional employment, shall not disclose, or be allowed to disclose such communication, nor shall the client be compelled to disclose such communication, in any action, disciplinary trial or hearing, or administrative action, proceeding or hearing conducted by or on behalf of any state, municipal or local government agency or by the legislature or any committee or body thereof. Evidence of any such communication obtained by any such person, and evidence resulting therefrom, shall not be disclosed by any state, municipal or local governmental agency or by the legislature or any committee or body thereof. The relationship of an attorney and client shall exist between a professional service corporation organized under article fifteen of the business corporation law to practice as an attorney and counselor-at-law and the clients to whom it renders legal services.”
However, since the privilege prevents disclosure of relevant evidence and thus impedes the grand jury’s quest for truth, it must “be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.” (In re Shargel, 742 F2d 61, 62 [2d Cir 1984], citing 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2291, at 554 [McNaughton rev 1961].) Indeed, it has long been recognized that “the attorney-client privilege constitutes an ‘obstacle’ to the truth-finding process, the invocation of which should be cautiously observed to ensure that its application is consistent with its purpose” (Matter of Jacqueline F., supra, 47 NY2d 215, 219 [1979]).
In exploring the extent of the privilege, the Court of Appeals has acknowledged that defining its limits is not an easy task and has offered as guidance that “ ‘much ought to depend on the circumstances of each case’ ” (see Matter of Jacqueline F., supra at 222; Matter of Kaplan [Blumenfeld], 8 NY2d 214, 219 [1960], quoting 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2313, at 609 [McNaughton rev 1961]). However, the court has set forth four general principles to be applied in determining whether certain communications are protected by the privilege (Priest v Hennessy, supra, 51 NY2d 62 [1980]). First, no attorney-client privilege can be claimed unless an attorney-client relationship has been established. The relationship arises when an attorney is contacted for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services. Second, it must be shown that the information sought to be protected by the privilege was a confidential communication made to the attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services. Third, the party claiming the privilege has the burden of proving each element of the privilege. Fourth, in a proper case, public policy may require disclosure (Priest v Henessy, supra, 51 NY2d at 68, 69).
In applying these principles to the issues before it, the court finds that the witnesses have not established that the questions propounded by the Assistant District Attorney before the grand jury require the divulgence of matter protected by attorney-client privilege.
It should be noted, initially, that each of the witnesses acknowledged in their testimony before the grand jury that they had possession of the laptop computer in question for a “brief period of time in November, 2001” but that they no longer had possession of it. However, when the Assistant District Attorney-sought information regarding who delivered the laptop to their offices and whether or not certain individuals were present when the laptop was delivered, each of them asserted that the information sought was protected by attorney-client privilege. Additionally, the witnesses asserted that same privilege when they were asked about what they did with the laptop while it was in their possession and whether or not they had the laptop computer or any portion of it copied while it was in their possession. Neither witness would answer the question of whether they had created the compact disc that had been produced in response to the subpoena or the significance of the initials “DPS” that had been written on the disc itself. Although the witnesses acknowledged that the compact disc that had been produced included all of the files from the laptop for the Rapid Eye security system, neither would answer questions about who decided which files to copy or who created the disc. Finally, the witnesses also refused to answer questions regarding how the laptop left their possession, to whom the laptop was given as well as questions about its present location.
In rejecting the arguments raised by the witnesses, the court initially finds that there is significant evidence in the record before it that this laptop was an instrumentality of the crime being investigated by this grand jury. The grand jury heard evidence that an Ademco video surveillance system had been installed in the home at 59 Middle Lane where the victim was murdered and that this system had the ability to store images from the digital video cameras located within the house on the “hard drive” of the system. There was also evidence that a person who possessed a laptop computer with the Ademco software installed on it could remotely view live images from the seven cameras located throughout the house and could also view images stored within the memory of the “hard drive” in the house. Further, there was testimony that the entire system could be controlled remotely from a laptop, including the ability to power down the system and to turn it back on.
The grand jury also heard evidence that one of the targets of the grand jury inquiry authorized the installation of the Ademco system in the victim’s residence and that the software necessary to access the hard drive of that system, as well as the live cameras, was installed on a laptop computer possessed by this target and which is the subject of this application. There was also testimony that this laptop was in the possession of the sister of this target at or about the time of the murder and that three months after the murder, the individual who is a target of this investigation married the widow of the murder victim. Testimonial evidence was also presented which established that the laptop computer in question was used to access the Ademco system numerous times on the weekend of the murder including the day before the body of the victim was first discovered. Surely, it might well be argued that under these circumstances, the laptop was used to help facilitate the commission of the murder under investigation.
In People v Investigation Into Certain Weapon (113 Misc 2d 348 [1982]), the court was presented with a motion to quash a grand jury subpoena duces tecum seeking the production of all tangible property relating to an automatic pistol, including ammunition and an ammunition clip. The underlying allegation involved a charge that a defendant, armed with two guns, had attempted to kill a police officer during the course of a robbery. One of the guns was later found but without its ammunition clip and bullets. The District Attorney maintained that the attorney for defendant had possession of these items and a subpoena was served upon him requiring their production. The attorney, while acknowledging possession of these items, moved to quash that subpoena upon the ground that any of the property received by him was the result of privileged communications between attorney and client.
The court rejected the arguments of counsel finding that any issue regarding privilege gave way to an attorney’s professional responsibilities when he is in possession of parts of a pistol which may have been involved in the commission of a crime. The court (at 352), acknowledging that it was an abuse of a lawyer’s professional duties to knowingly take possession of and secrete the instrumentalities of a crime, stated that “[t]he attorney-client privilege is not a cloak which permits either the defendant or his attorney to withhold evidence of criminality.” The court continued that “[o]therwise instrumentalities and fruits of crime would be beyond the reach of the law by the mere fact that a defendant turned them over to an attorney” (People v Investigation Into Certain Weapon, supra at 352). The court concluded that public policy requires that the tangible property, “for which there are reasonable grounds to believe may have been involved in a crime, should be made available to the Grand Jury for its investigation.” (Id.)
In the case at bar and as previously noted, there is reasonable grounds to believe that the laptop computer in question may have been involved in the commission of a crime. There was significant and credible evidence before the grand jury to support such a conclusion and nothing offered by either of the witnesses who are asserting the attorney-client privilege has suggested otherwise. In fact, there seems to be little argument that the laptop computer in question did have the ability to access the video surveillance system. This fact along with the evidence that the laptop did access the system on numerous times on the weekend in question is strong evidence to suggest that the laptop was involved in the commission of the crime and was, in fact, an instrumentality of that crime. To reach any other conclusion would be to ignore the evidence already before the grand jury and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.
It is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned case, the court reasoned that if it granted the motion to quash the subpoena, it would have been placing instrumentalities and fruits of crime beyond the reach of the law by the mere fact that defendant turned them over to an attorney. In the case at bar, if the court were to adopt the arguments raised by the witnesses, it would be placing the instrumentalities and fruits of the crime beyond the reach of the grand jury by the mere fact that counsel turned the evidence over to a third party.
The witnesses however argue that there exists a distinction between the facts in the case of People v Investigation Into Certain Weapon, where an attorney was required to produce physical evidence, and the case at bar where they are being asked to give testimonial evidence regarding that physical evidence. The court discerns no distinction. It is illogical to assert, as counsel for the witnesses appears to, that the court in that case would direct that counsel turn over the evidence in response to the subpoena, but if the attorney turns such evidence over to someone else, not require him to reveal the identity of the individual to whom he had given that evidence. To reach any other conclusion would be to sanction a methodology for the obstruction of the purpose of the grand jury, the investigation of criminal wrongdoing. As noted above, an attorney who is in possession of either evidence of or the instrumentality of a crime need only turn that evidence over to a third party to put that evidence beyond the reach of the grand jury. That result cannot be sanctioned.
Were this court to rule otherwise, such a ruling would be in contravention of the broad powers of the grand jury and would, in certain instances, authorize the perpetration of a fraud upon the grand jury and the public at large. While not suggesting that the conduct of the witnesses in this case has been anything less than ethical, it has been recognized that in instances involving the disposition of evidence of a crime, courts have not hesitated to acknowledge that the attorney-client privilege must yield to investigation of criminal wrongdoing. Thus, in Clark v United States (289 US 1, 15 [1933]), Mr. Justice Cardozo expressed the opinion that while “[t]here is a privilege protecting communications between attorney and client. . . [t]he privilege takes flight if the relation is abused. A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told.” Further, in Securities & Exch. Commn. v Harrison (80 F Supp 226, 230 [D DC 1948], appeal dismissed 184 F2d 691, judgment vacated as moot 340 US 908 [1950]), the court held that the attorney-client privilege has “never been intended to be, and should not be, a cloak or shield for the perpetration of a crime or fraudulent wrong doing. One who consults an attorney to secure aid or assistance in the perpetration of a future crime or fraudulent wrong doing is not consulting that attorney for the legitimate purposes which are protected by the privilege. If, therefore, it be shown by evidence other than the disclosure of the communications between client and attorney that aid or assistance is being sought for the perpetration of crime or fraudulent wrong doing, there is no immunity to the testimonial process respecting such communications.” Finally, it was noted in Clark v State (159 Tex Crim 187, 261 SW2d 339 [1953], cert denied and reh denied sub nom. 346 US 855, 905 [1953]) that a lawyer’s advice to get rid of a gun used to commit a murder was admissible in evidence over the objection that the statement was privileged. The court observed that the conversation was not within the realm of legitimate professional conduct and employment and was therefore not protected.
There is one issue raised by the witnesses that merits further discussion. As has been previously noted, one of the questions asked of the witnesses before the grand jury concerned the identity of the individual who gave them the laptop computer and the circumstances surrounding their receipt of it. Relying on the case of Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena of Stewart (144 Misc 2d 1012 [1989]), the witnesses assert that the grand jury has already heard evidence about the circumstances of the production of the laptop from the testimony of the sister of one of the targets of the grand jury inquiry and that, therefore, there is no need to compel this testimony from these witnesses. Certainly, the Assistant District Attorney has asserted that the grand jury has heard testimony regarding the turnover of the laptop computer to the witnesses. However, this testimony establishes that an individual other than the sister of the target was responsible for delivering the laptop to counsel’s office. Had the sister delivered the laptop to counsel, it might be argued that any testimony about the turnover might reveal conversations had between an attorney and client, but that is not the case here.
In reaching this conclusion, it is important to note that the court is not directing that the witnesses testify as to any conversations that the witnesses had with either their client or the client of any other attorney covered by the asserted joint defense agreement. The court is only directing them to reveal information regarding evidence that could be, at the very least, a critical part of the grand jury investigation and, quite possibly, the instrumentality of the crime being investigated. Of course, the court recognizes that the attorney-client privilege protects not only conventional utterances but also extends to acts, such as the production of an item, performed by the client in the attorney’s presence and intended by the client as a confidential communication (see, Prince, Richardson on Evidence § 5-205, at 235 [Farrell 11th ed]; see also, People v Daghita, 299 NY 194, 199 [1949]). However, there has been no evidence produced by the parties asserting the privilege that the laptop was turned over by a client or by any party covered by the asserted joint defense agreement. In fact, the evidence before the court as well as the grand jury is to the contrary.
With regard to the witnesses’ argument that compelling them to answer questions before the grand jury would require them to reveal attorney work product, there is no basis for such a claim. “[T]hree conditions must be met to earn work product protection. The material must (1) be a document or tangible thing, (2) that was prepared in anticipation of litigation, and (3) was prepared by or for a party, or by or for his representative.” (In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Dec. 18, 1981 & Jan. 4, 1982, 561 F Supp 1247, 1257 [1982]; see also, Weinhold v Witte Heavy Lift, Inc., 1994 WL 132392, 1994 US Dist LEXIS 4559 [1994].) Here, there is no doubt that the testimony about the location of the laptop computer cannot be considered attorney work product. The laptop computer and any of the information or images contained thereon was not prepared in anticipation of litigation but rather is evidence of what transpired inside the residence on 59 Middle Lane, East Hampton, New York. Moreover, it is disingenuous for counsel to argue that the laptop is attorney work product and yet, at the same time, argue to the court that it no longer has possession of that work product.
Finally, there exists one issue that was raised by the court during the course of oral argument before it. It is agreed by all of the parties that in response to the subpoena, the witnesses produced a compact disc that they alleged contained all of the relevant files from the laptop in question involving the video surveillance system at 59 Middle Lane, East Hampton. In light of the fact that the witnesses were asserting attorney-client privilege with respect to the laptop and any information about it, the court inquired whether that privilege had been waived by the parties when they partially disclosed information from the laptop (see, Johnson Matthey, Inc. v Research Corp., 2002 WL 1728566, 2002 US Dist LEXIS 13560 [2002]). In response to the inquiry, both sides asserted before the court that an agreement was reached whereby the production by the witnesses of the compact disc would not result in any waiver of any privilege with respect to any other evidence. Although not acknowledging that the court or the grand jury is bound by the agreements reached between the Assistant District Attorney and counsel for the witnesses, the court finds that there exists an ample and independent basis, aside from the issue of waiver, for the court to grant the application.
Accordingly, the application by the Assistant District Attorney to compel the witnesses to answer questions regarding their receipt of a certain laptop computer as well as its subsequent transfer to third parties along with any questions regarding what was done to the laptop while in the possession of the witnesses is granted. The witnesses, who have each been served with a subpoena and who were in the process of testifying before the grand jury at the time that the present application was made, are directed to reappear before the grand jury to continue their testimony at the convenience of the grand jury and the Assistant District Attorney assigned to this investigation.
. In response to the subpoena, the witnesses produced a compact disc which “was created from the hard drive of a laptop computer that had the ability to access the video security system at 59 Middle Lane, East Hampton, New York.”

0308-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
James C. Harberson, J.
The defendant has been charged with a violation of article 37, § 1814 (a) (1) of the Tax Law: “Attempt to evade or defeat tax.”
The accusatory instrument alleges that the defendant on March 19, 2003 at 440 S. Massey Street in the City of Water-town, New York, violated this statute “by possessing 45 cartons of untaxed cigarettes and 30 cans of untaxed chewing tobacco on which the New York excise tax had not been paid.” The accusatory instrument also makes reference to the statement of the defendant, Jeannie Cousins and Edward Claflin who are codefendants.
The defendant in his supporting deposition admitted allowing Cousins to use his credit card to order cigarettes from an Internet site which included some cigarettes for the defendant. This conduct occurred about once a month over a three-month period. The defendant said he asked Cousins to reduce the size of the order because he “[H]eard that some people had been getting arrested for having to[o] many untaxed cigarettes. I ordered four cartons this time.”
Edward Claflin stated in his supporting deposition that Cousins purchased untaxed cigarettes from Acorn Tobacco Co. near Rochester, New York, which were delivered by U.ES. to her home using Leo Tracy’s credit card. She took orders from Claflin and Tracy among others.
Jeannie Cousins stated in her supporting deposition that about three months ago (Mar. 19, 2003) she ordered cigarettes from the Acorn Smoke Shop in Irving, New York, over the phone using Leo Tracy’s credit card. They were shipped to her and Leo Tracy would “come over and pick them up” — his share of the order. She said at no time did anyone at Acorn Smoke Shop ever advise her that “possessing untaxed cigarettes was a crime.”
The prosecution also filed a record prepared by the New York State Office of Tax Enforcement with a report narrative which read: “also arrested . . . Leo F. Tracy . . . arrested for Attempt to Evade and Defeat Tax, 1814 (a)-(l) because he paid for the product.”
A copy of the invoice of Acorn showed that the untaxed cigarettes seized at Cousins’ home were billed to Leo Tracy and shipped to Cousins’ home address.
Issues
The defense moves for dismissal of the accusatory instrument because of a failure to allege the defendant “actually took any action to evade a tax” but rather “[m]erely that he possessed untaxed cigarettes.” The defense further argues that the accusatory instrument fails to allege the defendant did not pay taxes on the cigarettes or file a tax return.
The prosecution opposes the defense argument on the grounds that the accusatory instrument when read together with the supporting depositions and other evidence provide sufficient reasonable cause to believe the defendant violated section 1814 (a) (1) and each element thereof is established as required by CPL 100.40 (1) (a), (b) and (c).
Law
Article 20 of the Tax Law imposes a tax on cigarettes acquired or used in the state (§§ 471, 471-a) as well as on tobacco products (§§ 471-b, 471-c).
Section 471 (1) and section 471-b (1) both use identical wording to the effect that “no tax shall be imposed on cigarettes [tobacco products] sold under such circumstances that this state is without power to impose such tax or sold to the United States or sold to or by a voluntary unincorporated organization of the armed forces of the United States operating a place for the sale of goods . . . .”
Sections 471-a and 471-c use identical wording imposing a use tax on cigarettes or tobacco products “used in the state by any person, except that no tax shall be imposed (1) if the tax provided in section [471 or 471-b] is paid, (2) on the use of cigarettes which are exempt from tax imposed by said section [s], or (3) on the use of four hundred or less cigarettes, brought into the state on, or in the possession of, any person.” These sections provide that “[w]ithin twenty-four hours after liability for the tax accrues, each person shall file with the commissioner a return in such form as the commissioner may prescribe together with a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon.”
Sections 471-a and 471-c conclude by stating that “[a]ll other provisions of this article if not inconsistent shall apply to the administration and enforcement of the tax imposed by this section in the same manner as if the language of said provisions had been incorporated in full into this section.”
This means that incorporated by reference into sections 471-a and 471-c is the wording found at both section 471 (1) and section 471-b (1) that “[i]t shall be presumed that all cigarettes [tobacco products] within the state are subject to tax until the contrary is established, and the burden of proof that any cigarettes [tobacco products] are not taxable hereunder shall be upon the person in possession thereof.”
Tax Law § 1814 (a) states: “(a) Attempt to evade or defeat tax. (1) Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by article twenty of this chapter [Tax Law § 470 et seq.] or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor.”
In Matter of New York Assn. of Convenience Stores v Urbach (169 Misc 2d 906 [1996]), the court commented concerning section 471 (1) of the Tax Law:
“[T]hese taxes are paid by the purchase of stamps which are affixed to the cigarette package as a prerequisite to the first taxable sale by a wholesaler or distributor ... [A] tax is then added to the selling price of the cigarettes along the distribution chain and is ultimately added to the retail price charged to the retail customer.” {Id. at 909.)
The court after noting that Indian retailers selling cigarettes on their reservation have no obligation to collect cigarette taxes imposed by section 471 (1) concluded that “[n]on-Indian purchasers of cigarettes from on-reservation Indian retailers are required to pay the excise and sales taxes.” {Id. at 909.)
CPL 100.40 (1) (a), (b) and (c) defines what an accusatory instrument must contain in order to be facially sufficient. In People v Alejandro (70 NY2d 133 [1987]), the Court stated: “We conclude than an information which fails to contain nonhearsay allegations establishing ‘if true, every element of the offense charged and the defendant’s commission thereof (CPL 100.40 [1] [c]) is fatally defective.” {Id. at 136.) The Court said “an ‘information’ (charging a misdemeanor or petty offense) must demonstrate both ‘reasonable cause’ and a ‘legally sufficient’ or prima facie case {id. [1-b, c]) — a much more demanding standard.” {Id. at 139.)
The question is whether this accusatory instrument has the requisite “non-hearsay allegations [in] the factual part of the information [that] establish if true, every element of the offense charged and the defendant’s commission thereof.”
Decision
Article 20, §§ 471 and 471-b define how cigarettes and tobacco products are taxed and then marked with stamps so that at the time of sale to a consumer all these cumulative taxes “added . . . along the distribution chain [are] ultimately added to the retail price [and] charged to the retail customer” (New York Assn. of Convenience Stores v Urbach, supra at 909).
Article 20, § 471 (1) and § 471-b (1) stated that no tax shall be imposed “under such circumstances that this state is without power to impose such tax.” These “circumstances” refer to sales on Indian reservations as explained in Matter of New York Assn. of Convenience Stores v Urbach (275 AD2d 520 [2000], revd 92 NY2d 204 [1998]), which state in effect that since the State cannot reach an agreement with Indians to collect the taxes on their sales, the State is left with collecting them from non-Indian purchasers directly.
Article 20, §§ 471-a and 471-c impose a use tax on cigarettes and tobacco products for which the taxes under section 471 or section 471-b have not been paid. The use tax must be paid to the commissioner “in such form as the commissioner may prescribe together with a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon” (§§ 471-a, 471-c).
The word “use” is defined by identical language in both sections 471-a and 471-c: “[f]or purposes of this article, the word ‘use’ means the exercise of any right or power actual or constructive and shall include but is not limited to the receipt, storage or any keeping or retention for any length of time, but shall not include possession for sale.”
Also, both sections state “[a]ll other provisions of this article if not inconsistent shall apply to the administration and enforcement of the tax imposed by this section in the same manner as if the language of said provisions had been incorporated in full into this section.”
The court finds that Indians can sell cigarettes or tobacco products to Indians and non-Indian customers without collecting the taxes due upon such at the time of the sale. Non-Indians who obtain such nontaxed cigarettes or tobacco products are responsible to pay a “use” tax within 24 hours of gaining “use” of them in New York State outside of Indian lands as that term is defined in sections 471-a and 471-c.
While the possession, then, of untaxed tobacco products or cigarettes creates a presumption state taxes are due “until the contrary is established” (§ 471 [1]; § 471-b [1]) because the law also recognizes one who obtains untaxed products has “twenty-four hours after liability for the tax accrues” to pay the use tax (§§ 471-a, 471-c), until that time period (24-hour window) has passed a person may possess untaxed cigarettes or tobacco products without violating the statute so long as there is compliance with the filing of the required reports with “remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon” (§§ 471-a, 471-c) before the end of the 24-hour period with the commissioner.
In this case the defendant allowed his credit card to be used to order cigarettes and tobacco products from an Indian retailer to be delivered by U.ES. to an address of a relative. He expected to acquire four cartons of cigarettes from this shipment.
The accusatory instrument states that on “the 19th day of March 2003, at 440 South Massey Street . . . [the defendant] did willfully attempt in any manner to evade or defeat the excise tax imposed by Article 20 of this Chapter by possessing . . . untaxed cigarettes and . . . untaxed chewing tobacco on which the New York State excise tax had not been paid . . .
The defendant in his statement said he allowed his niece to use his credit card to order cigarettes over the Internet so he had her order some for him as well. He said he advised her not to order so many because “some people had been getting arrested for having to[o] many untaxed cigarettes.” “I ordered about four cartons this time” (see statement of Leo Tracy, dated Mar. 19, 2003).
The investigator in a note affixed to his report said: “[a]Iso arrested in this case was Leo F. Tracy . . . EO. box 902 . . . for attempt to evade and defeat tax ... a search warrant was executed on 9/19/03 at the above residence [after] a delivery of. . . untaxed cigarettes and . . . chewing tobacco had been made just prior to executing the search warrant. He was charged under Tax Law Section 1814 (a) (1).” Section 1814 (a) (1) states: “(a) Attempt to evade or defeat tax. (1) Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by article twenty of this chapter [Tax Law § 470 et seq.] or the payment thereof shall ... be guilty of a misdemeanor.”
There is no factual allegation in the accusatory instrument nor “any supporting depositions” or business records (an exception to hearsay rule) that the 24-hour period during which the defendant could have paid the use tax on these tobacco products or cigarettes as provided at sections 471-a and 471-c had passed before these items were seized at 440 S. Massey Street assuming the moment of delivery started the 24-hour countdown clock.
If the products were seized before that time period had expired, then at that point no law had been violated. If the products were seized after that time period had passed, then there would have been a violation of the use tax payment requirements as set out at sections 471-a and 471-c.
The presumption that untaxed cigarettes and tobacco products “are subject to the tax” until the person in possession of them proves otherwise (§ 471 [1]; § 471-b [1]) is (delayed) inapplicable during the 24-hour period within which a use tax is allowed to be paid by the consumer under sections 471-a and 471-c. This is because the law allows possession of untaxed cigarettes and tobacco products that are “subject to the tax” for a 24-hour period before it is due especially when, as in this case, the state agents have personal knowledge of when that period commenced.
This conclusion allows these various sections of the statute to operate “harmoniously rather than in conflict (Statutes § 98 [b])” (People v Gorman, 195 Misc 2d 211, 215 [2003]) and reject a statutory construction which would avoid the absurdity (McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 145; id. at 213) of allowing a person to pay a use tax within a stated 24-hour period while allowing possession of the untaxed products during that time as well as to be basis of a presumption that taxes that are not yet due have not been paid before they are due.
This construction also prevents state agents from basing any invasion of a person’s legitimate expectation of privacy when in possession of untaxed cigarettes or tobacco products based on the presumption that the tax is due to justify their approach of a citizen within the 24-hour period after receipt of which, when they have personal knowledge of the commencement thereof before that period of time has expired (see, People v De Bour, 40 NY2d 210 [1976]; People v Hollman, 79 NY2d 181 [1992]).
The accusatory instrument alleging that the defendant had violated section 1814 (a) (1) failed to contain a “non-hearsay allegation establishing [an] element of the offense charged,” to wit: that from the time the use of these products began to “accrue” 24 hours had passed before their seizure by the authorities. For this reason the court finds that the People have failed to provide a factual allegation in the information that the 24-hour time period had expired during which the defendant could pay the State use tax to avoid criminal liability under section 1814 (a) (1) of the Tax Law.
The charge is dismissed.",1
0586-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
John R. LaCava, J.
This is a declaratory judgment action brought to determine the validity of a right of first refusal to purchase an unimproved 13,493-square-foot piece of property located on Oak Street in the City of New Rochelle. The property is identified on the tax maps of the City of New Rochelle as block 267, lot 3 (lot 3). Plaintiffs Edward I. Herrmann and Lawrence A. Herrmann came into title of lot 3 as residuary estate devisees under the last will and testament of their late father, Herbert R. Herrmann (Mr. Herrmann), who died March 26, 1988 and whose will was admitted to probate on July 8, 1988.
The subject right of first refusal (the right) is found in a recorded lease surrender agreement dated May 19, 1982 between Mr. Herrmann and Certified Fence Corp., a former lessee and, thereafter, owner of an adjoining improved lot (lot 2, block 267 [lot 2]). Certified Fence remained a tenant of lot 3 until 2001 when, in connection with its sale of lot 2 to defendant AMD Realty, Inc., Certified Fence surrendered lot 3 to plaintiffs, and assigned the right of first refusal to lot 3 to defendant AMD.
The action was initiated when, while plaintiffs were attempting to sell lot 3 to a third party, Westchester Autoplex, for $300,000, plaintiffs became aware of the existence of the recorded right of first refusal now possessed by defendant AMD. In response, plaintiffs canceled the contract with Autoplex and entered into a lease with that would-be purchaser and, as part of the lease arrangement, agreed to initiate this declaratory judgment action.
The pertinent part of the lease surrender agreement reads as follows:
“The following provisions of the lease are to survive delivery of the deed and remain and continue in full force and effect until such time as Herbert R. Herrmann divests himself of the ownership of the rear property known as Lot 3, Block 267 on the Land Map of the City of New Rochelle.
“If at any time the landlord shall receive a bona fide offer from any party to purchase the rear lots in back of the premises, Landlord shall send Tenant a copy of the proposed contract (except for the name of the buyer) and notify tenant of the intention of the landlord to accept the same. Tenant shall have the right within ten (10) days to accept the terms of said contract in its own name for the gross purchase price (which in the case of the tenant shall not exceed Seventy-five Thousand ($75,000.00) Dollars of the purchase price) and all the other terms specified in the contract. If tenant shall not so elect within the said period, landlord may then sell the rear lots to the buyer, provided said sale is on the same terms and conditions and for the price set forth in said contract sent to the tenant, subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in the contract of sale dated March 17, 1982.
“Whenever the word ‘Tenant’ appears in the foregoing it shall be deemed to mean Rocco Medeo and Lenore Medeo, his wife, and wherever the word ‘Landlord’ appears it shall be deemed to mean Herbert R. Herrmann.”
At the outset, the court concludes that the right of first refusal does not constitute an impermissible restraint upon the alienation of the property pursuant to the statutory rule against perpetuities as is codified in EPTL 9-1.1 (b).
“[In Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v Bruken Realty Corp. (67 NY2d 156 [1986]), the Court of Appeals] held that EPTL 9-1.1 (b) did not apply to a preemptive right in a ‘commercial and governmental transaction’ that lasted beyond the statutory perpetuities period. In doing so, [the Court] explained that, unlike options, preemptive rights (or rights of first refusal) only marginally affect transferability:
“ ‘An option grants to the holder the power to compel the owner of property to sell it whether the owner is willing to part with ownership or not. A preemptive right, or right of first refusal, does not give its holder the power to compel an unwilling owner to sell; it merely requires the owner, when and if he decides to sell, to offer the property first to the party holding the preemptive right so that he may meet a third-party offer or buy the property at some other price set by a previously stipulated method’ (id., at 163).” (Symphony Space v Pergola Props., 88 NY2d 466, 478-479 [1996].)
In any event, the court concludes that the right expired upon Mr. Herrmann’s death. Most pertinent in this regard is that the lease surrender agreement makes no reference to the parties’ successors and/or assigns, and it expressly directs that “wherever the word ‘Landlord’ appears it shall be deemed to mean Herbert R. Herrmann.” When coupling the logistics of the exercise of the option with the $75,000 cost cap, for which no explanation has been advanced, it becomes clear that the parties intended that the right of first refusal would expire, at the latest, upon Mr. Herrmann’s death, even though, in the strict legal sense, one does not “divest” oneself of property upon death.
However, even when assuming without so finding that the right is assignable, survived Mr. Herrmann’s death, and does not violate the statutory rules against alienation of property (see, EPTL 9-1.1), the court would still have to rule in plaintiffs’ favor.
In addition to the statutory rule against perpetuities found in EPTL 9-1.1,
“New York also retains the more flexible common-law rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation. Unlike the statutory Rule against Perpetuities, which is measured exclusively by the passage of time, the common-law rule evaluates the reasonableness of the restraint based on its duration, purpose and designated method for fixing the purchase price. (See, Wildenstein & Co. v Wallis, 79 NY2d at 648; Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v Bruken Realty Corp., 67 NY2d at 161-162, supra.)” (Symphony Space v Pergola Props., supra at 476.)
The subject right requires, inter alia, that the property be made available first to the party holding the preemptive right, here AMD, which then has 10 days to decide whether to purchase it. The 10-day notice period is not to see if AMD wishes to meet a third-party offer or market value; instead, it is to see if AMD wishes to purchase the property at the previously agreed upon maximum price of $75,000.
Duration is not an issue. Duration is measured by the period during which the right may be exercised (see, Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v Bruken Realty Corp., 67 NY2d 156, 167 [1986]), which here is a mere 10 days from the date of notice.
As previously stated, however,
“[reasonableness also depends on price, for the method by which the price is set can be critical in determining whether a preemptive right unlawfully restrains transfers. Where the holder has a right to purchase at a fixed price, or at a price less than that offered in the market, it is likely to involve a sacrifice by the owner if he wishes to transfer the property, thus becoming a far more serious interference with alienability ... A preemptive right, however, usually will not be unlawful when conditioned on payment of market value or a sum equal to a third-party offer (see, Restatement of Property § 413 [1944]; and see generally, Ann., 40 ALR3d 920 § 4).” (Id. at 167-168 [citations omitted].)
Upon viewing the $75,000 purchase price cap contained in the right of first refusal against (a) the $300,000 price reflected in the since terminated contract between plaintiffs and Autoplex and (b) the 2001 appraised value of $270,000, neither of which are challenged here, this court finds, as a matter of law, that the subject right of first refusal constitutes an unreasonable restraint on the alienation of plaintiffs’ property. As such, it is null and void and is unenforceable.
Based upon the foregoing, it is hereby ordered, adjudged and declared that the right of first refusal containing the' lease surrender agreement dated May 19, 1982 between Herbert R. Herrmann and Certified Fence Corp., which was recorded on March 26, 2001 in the office of the Westchester County Clerk, Division of Land Records, in Liber 11410, page 231, is null and void; and, it is further ordered that the office of the Westchester County Clerk shall take whatever action may be necessary to cancel the subject right of record.
. EPTL 9-1.1 (b) provides: “No estate in property shall be valid unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after one or more lives in being at the creation of the estate and any period of gestation involved. In no case shall lives measuring the permissible period of vesting be so designated or so numerous as to make proof of their end unreasonably difficult.”
. Since neither party has advanced the bargained for or any other purpose or reason for which the subject right and/or its price cap were created, the “purpose” factor has not persuaded the court to rule one way or another.",0

Christopher J. Mega, J.
Motion (No. 907) of defendants Cassino Contracting Corp. and Veterans Property, Inc., sued herein as Veteran Properties, Inc., for partial summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs lost earnings claim, and the cross motions (Nos. 979, 1279, 1841, 2668) of defendants New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company, Inc., sued herein as New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company, D & Sons Construction Corp., the City of New York and third-party defendant Alum-A-Pole Corp. for like relief, are granted.
Plaintiff Stanislaw Majlinger, an immigrant from Poland, commenced this action to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by him when he fell from a scaffold while installing siding on property known as 295 Skyline Drive, Staten Island, New York. It is uncontroverted that plaintiff was employed by J & C Home Improvement, which was hired to provide roofing and siding to the aforementioned premises. Plaintiffs causes of action against defendants are based on negligence and violations of Labor Law §§ 200, 240 (1) and § 241 (6).
In a prior motion and cross motion, defendants Cassino Contracting Corp., Veteran Properties, Inc. (hereinafter Veterans Property), Jack Thaon, Celebration, LLC, and New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company moved for an order requiring plaintiff to respond to their demands for discovery regarding plaintiffs immigration status and his eligibility for employment in this country. This court granted those motions in its decision and order dated February 10, 2003, and ordered plaintiff to respond to their discovery demands. Thereafter, plaintiff responded by indicating that he was not in possession of any of the required documents that would establish his eligibility for employment in the United States.
In the present application, defendants Cassino and Veterans Property move for partial summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims for lost earnings since he cannot establish that he is eligible for employment in the United States. According to these defendants, federal immigration law precludes an undocumented alien from recovering lost wages for work not performed, and therefore, if plaintiff cannot establish his eligibility for employment in this country, his claim for lost wages must be dismissed. Defendants rely primarily upon the United States Supreme Court decision in Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v National Labor Relations Bd. (535 US 137 [2002]), wherein the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was foreclosed from awarding back pay to an undocumented alien unlawfully terminated for union activity where it appeared that the worker had never been legally authorized to work in the United States.
Defendants New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company, Inc., sued herein as New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company, D & Sons Construction Corp., the City of New York and third-party defendant Alum-A-Pole Corp. adopt and incorporate by reference the arguments set forth in the motion by defendants Cassino and Veterans Property.
In opposition, plaintiff contends, inter alia, that New York law specifically permits the recovery of lost wages by undocumented aliens. Plaintiff further contends that the decision in Hoffman is inapplicable to the case at bar since Hoffman dealt with the propriety of an award by a federal agency and was not intended to be binding precedent upon state courts with respect to the issue of whether an unauthorized alien is entitled to pursue a claim for lost earnings under state common law.
Although New York law has, in the past, permitted the recovery of lost wages for undocumented illegal aliens (see e.g. Public Adm’r of Bronx County v Equitable Life Assur. Socy., 192 AD2d 325 [1st Dept 1993]; Collins v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 201 AD2d 447 [2d Dept 1994]), the interpretation afforded to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) by the United States Supreme Court in Hoffman would appear to require this court to conclude that plaintiff should not be permitted to recover for lost wages given his inability to prove he is legally authorized to work in this country. It would be consistent to reserve lost wages awards to those workers who have demonstrated a right to be lawfully employed and reinstated in their jobs.
In Hoffman, the NLRB was foreclosed from awarding back pay to an undocumented alien unlawfully terminated for union activity where it appeared that the worker had never been legally authorized to work in the United States. In the course of so doing, the Supreme Court observed that the IRCA was conceived as a “comprehensive scheme” to combat the employment of illegal aliens in the United States which “forcefully” elevated the prohibition of such employment to a “central” position in the implementation of federal immigration policy by attempting to “diminish the attractive force of employment, which like a ‘magnet’ pulls illegal immigrants towards the United States. H.R. Rep. No. 99-682, pt. 1, at 45 (1986).” (At 147, 155.) Critically, the Court therein specifically noted that awarding back pay to illegal aliens for work not performed runs counter to the policies underlying the IRCA, which made the knowing employment of illegal immigrants unlawful, and thereby serves to marginalize federal immigration laws.
By a parity of reasoning, for this court to sanction the recovery of lost wages by an undocumented alien for work not performed would run contrary to both the letter and spirit of the IRCA, whose salutory purpose it would simultaneously undermine. Manifestly, it is not within the power or competence of this court to encroach, even by indirection, upon the immigration policy of these United States. On constraint of Hoffman, it is therefore the determination of this court that plaintiffs claim for lost wages must be dismissed (accord generally Renteria v Italia Foods, Inc., 2003 WL 21995190, 2003 US Dist LEXIS 14698 [ND Ill, Aug. 21, 2003]; cf. Cox, A Call to Revisit Sure-Tan v. NLRB: Undocumented Workers and Their Right to Back Pay, 30 SW U L Rev 505 [2001]).
In so doing, this court is not unmindful of the contrary opinions expressed by other courts of original jurisdiction regarding the matter at hand, but must respectfully disagree and look to our appellate courts for guidance.
Accordingly, it is ordered that the motion for partial summary judgment of defendants Cassino Contracting Corp. and Veterans Property, Inc., and the cross motions for partial summary judgment of defendants New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company, Inc., sued herein as New York City Partnership Housing Development Fund Company, D & Sons Construction Corp., the City of New York and third-party defendant Alum-A-Pole Corp. are granted to the extent that plaintiffs claim for lost wages are hereby severed and dismissed.",0
0050-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Per Curiam.
Order and judgment each entered on or about February 27, 2002 reversed, without costs, defendant’s counterclaims are dismissed and judgment is awarded to plaintiff on the main action in the principal sum of $2,148.59.
The doctrine of res judicata requires dismissal of the breach of contract and fraud counterclaims interposed by defendant in this small claims action, since defendant had the opportunity to raise those claims in the prior Supreme Court declaratory judgment action between these parties and involving the same real estate transaction (see, Sandcham Realty Corp. v Taub, 299 AD2d 220, 221 [2002]). Common to both proceedings was the issue of whether or not defendant defaulted under the payment terms of the mortgage note, a question necessarily hinging upon the defendant’s claimed entitlement— expressly asserted by defendant in both actions — to offset from the loan amount the replacement cost of allegedly defective kitchen appliances. In this posture, and given the identity of issue between the two actions, defendant is barred by the adverse result in the declaratory judgment action from relitigating the question of her indebtedness under the note. That the former declaratory judgment action ultimately was resolved on the basis of defendant’s default is immaterial, for “res judicata embraces not only those matters which are actually litigated before a court but also those relevant issues which could have been litigated” (Buechel v Bain, 275 AD2d 65, 72 [2000], quoting Boorman v Deutsch, 152 AD2d 48, 53 [1989], lv dismissed 76 NY2d 889 [1990]; see, Trisingh Enters. v Kessler, 249 AD2d 45 [1998]). In the absence of any viable defense to the small claims action, plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of “substantial justice” consistent with substantive law principles (see, CCA 1807).
From a procedural standpoint, we note the improper admission at trial of unsworn defense testimony. Contrary to the court’s stated view, the unelaborated status of two defense witnesses as “officers of the court” provided no basis for dispensing with a formal oath (see, Prince, Richardson on Evidence § 6-104 [Farrell 11th ed]). All persons testifying in a civil action, irrespective of profession or affiliation to the court system, must “go through the same swearing ceremony required of all witnesses.” (Siegel, NY Prac § 388, at 624 [3d ed]; see, CPLR 2309 [b].) While our merits determination in this matter makes it unnecessary for us to dispositively determine whether the unobjected to admission of unsworn testimony would alone warrant reversal and a new trial (see, Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac 1i 2309.05), we caution that compliance with mandatory oath requirements is no less important in the context of small claims trials than it is in civil trials generally. The salutary functions of a formal oath — “to awaken the witness to his moral duty to tell the truth . . . and ... to deter false testimony by providing a legal ground for perjury prosecutions” (Matter of Brown v Ristich, 36 NY2d 183, 189 [1975]) — apply with equal force regardless of the judicial forum selected for litigation.

Martin Schneier, J.
The petitioner in this case is a former emergency medical technician (EMT) for the New York City Fire Department. Petitioner sought an ordinary disability pension on the grounds that he is disabled due to AIDS. He also sought an accidental disability pension on the grounds that he contracted HIV as the result of a line of duty exposure. The respondent New York City Employees’ Retirement System (NYCERS) granted the ordinary disability pension but denied the accidental disability pension. Petitioner initiated this CPLR article 78 proceeding alleging that NYCERS misinterpreted the statutory presumption contained in section 207-o of the General Municipal Law. Section 207-o states, in pertinent part:
“a paid employee who performs the functions of an emergency medical technician or advanced emergency medical technician, where such employee is drawn from competitive civil service lists and successfully passed a physical examination on employment, who, on or after March seventeenth, nineteen hundred ninety-six, contracts HIV (where the employee may have been exposed to a bodily fluid of a person under his or her care or treatment, or while the employee examined, transported or otherwise had contact with such person, in the performance of his or her duties) tuberculosis or hepatitis, will be presumed to have contracted such disease as a natural and proximate result of an accidental injury received in the performance or discharge of his or her duties and not resulting from his or her willful negligence, unless the contrary be proved by competent evidence.”
In rejecting the accidental disability claim, the NYCERS Medical Board Report stated tersely that “[t]he initial application had been made for disability due to exposure in the course of employment resulting in AIDS. The documentary evidence [for] such a claim was not forthcoming.” Previous applications for an accidental disability pension had been met with demands for documentary proof of an on-the-job exposure. Petitioner had submitted affidavits that purported to document exposures, but the respondents aver that they were unable to verify these occurrences.
As a threshold matter, the court finds that the procedure followed by NYCERS was improper. The Medical Board is required to determine any issue related to an applicant’s disability (Administrative Code of City of NY § 13-168 [a]). Once petitioner submitted evidence that the presumption was applicable, it was incumbent on NYCERS to apply the presumption or engage in fact-finding and disprove its basis. In this case the Medical Board abdicated its fact-finding function and instead crafted an extra statutory condition precedent. Because of this, the court finds that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.
Furthermore, the court finds the decision by NYCERS not to consider whether the presumption applies was affected by its misinterpretation of the statute. Respondents urge the court to “limit the applicability of the HIV statute to those EMT’s suffering from HIV who can prove that they suffered an exposure to bodily fluids carrying the virus of a person under their care while performing their duties” (respondents’ mem of law at 17).
Ordinarily, the “construction given statutes and regulations by the agency responsible for their administration, if not irrational or unreasonable, should be upheld” (Matter of Barie v Lavine, 40 NY2d 565, 568 [1976]). “Where, however, the question is one of pure statutory reading and analysis, dependent only on accurate apprehension of legislative intent, there is little basis to rely on any special competence or expertise of the administrative agency and its interpretive regulations are therefore to be accorded much less weight. And, of course, if the regulation runs counter to the clear wording of a statutory provision, it should not be accorded any weight.” (Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., 49 NY2d 451, 458 [1980].)
In this case the respondents make two assertions that are contrary to the clear language of the statute. First, the statute does not require proof of an exposure to bodily fluids; it applies “where the employee may have been exposed to a bodily fluid” (General Municipal Law § 207-o [emphasis added]). It is a rule of statutory construction that every word is to be given effect (McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 231). The construction offered by respondents reads the word “may” out of the statute and must, therefore, be rejected.
Second, respondents assert that the statute requires an exposure to bodily fluids containing the HIV virus. The statute, however, does not require that the bodily fluids contain the HIV virus. In this instance the respondents’ interpretation must be rejected because it reads language into the statute.
Accordingly, the court finds that the decision rejecting the petitioner’s accidental disability claim was arbitrary and capricious because NYCERS misinterpreted the statute and abdicated its fact-finding role.
Therefore, the case is remanded to NYCERS for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.",0

Per Curiam.
Judgment of conviction rendered July 9, 1999 affirmed.
Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is unpreserved for appellate review, since defendant merely moved for a general trial order of dismissal and did not raise the alleged insufficiencies now urged on appeal (see, People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 19 [1995]). In any event, were we to review, we would find that the driving element of the driving while intoxicated offenses here charged was established beyond a reasonable doubt by credited prosecution testimony that moments after the vehicular collision defendant was found seated in the driver’s seat of his otherwise unoccupied car with seat belt fastened and air bag deployed, as well as defendant’s own statements concerning the events immediately preceding the accident (see, People v Charland, 194 AD2d 827 [1993]; People v Saplin, 122 AD2d 498 [1986], lv denied 68 NY2d 817 [1986]). Upon an independent review of the facts, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.
The court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant’s CPL 330.30 (3) motion without a hearing, since defendant’s motion papers failed to contain sworn allegations of fact (CPL 330.40 [2] [e] [ii]) and the purported newly discovered evidence was not shown to have been undiscoverable prior to or during trial and was not of such nature that it would probably change the result if a new trial were held (see, People v Taylor, 246 AD2d 410, 411-412 [1998], lv denied 91 NY2d 978 [1998]).
Also unavailing is defendant’s contention that the accusatory instrument was jurisdictionally defective by failing to include nonhearsay allegations supporting the charged offenses. The factual portion of the underlying misdemeanor information contained defendant’s statement at the accident scene, “I was driving and the guy in front of me slammed on his brakes.” Defendant’s statement, which was clearly inculpatory, was non-hearsay (see, Matter of Rodney J., 108 AD2d 307, 311 [1985]; Matter of Christopher P., 260 AD2d 212, 213 [1999]; Matter of Todd Z., 295 AD2d 652, 653 [2002]). To the extent that the confession corroboration requirement of CPL 60.50 is properly applied in the context of this misdemeanor prosecution (compare, People v Kaminiski, 143 Misc 2d 1089 [1989], with People v Heller, 180 Misc 2d 160 [1998]; see also, Matter of Rodney J., 108 AD2d 307 [1985]), the requirement was satisfied by the information herein, which contains nonhearsay allegations based upon the arresting police officer’s own observations sufficiently corroborating the occurrence of the offense (see, People v Olwes, 191 Misc 2d 275, 279-280 [2002]; see also, People v Booden, 69 NY2d 185 [1987]).
Defendant’s remaining arguments are either unpreserved for review or lacking in merit.

Appeal from the April 26, 2001 order unanimously dismissed.
Final judgment unanimously affirmed without costs.
Order dated August 31, 2001 unanimously affirmed without costs.
The right of appeal from the intermediate order dated April 26, 2001 terminated with the entry of judgment (Matter of Aho, 39 NY2d 241, 248 [1976]). The issues raised in the appeal from said order are brought up and reviewed on the appeal from the final judgment (CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).
An affidavit of service upon a 13 year old alleged to be a person of suitable age and discretion does not trigger the necessity of a traverse hearing on the bare allegation that said 13 year old lacked the necessary discretion. While the adoption of the “suitable age” language in RPAPL 735 implies that “at some point a person should be deemed by the court, as a matter of law, to be too young to have a valid status as deliveree” (Room Additions v Howard, 124 Misc 2d 19 [Civ Ct, Bronx County 1984]), we cannot say that a 13 year old is incapable of accepting service as a matter of law under RPAPL 735 (Chemical Bank v Muller, NYLJ, Aug. 24, 1995, at 28, col 5 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County] [“Courts have routinely held that persons younger than fifteen are of appropriate maturity to accept service”]; Bradian v Chavez, NYLJ, Apr. 23, 1968, at 16, col 6 [Sup Ct, Bronx County] [upholding service on a 13 year old]; Durham Prods. v Sterling Film Portfolio, Ltd., Series A, 537 F Supp 1241, 1244 [1982] [12 year old a person of suitable discretion under CPLR 308 (2)]). Insofar as tenants claim that their daughter was not a person of suitable discretion, the assertions raised in tenants’ supporting affidavit, even if true, did not create a triable issue of the daughter’s capacity for discretion.
We also reject tenants’ claim that the court improperly inhibited their attempt to prove that the license agreement, which granted tenants temporary residence in an apartment managed by the Village of Nyack Housing Authority, as an emergency measure and notwithstanding the lengthy waiting list of applicants for housing, resulted from unfair dealing or fraud. The agreement, whose terms were settled after lengthy negotiations between the parties’ counsel, denied tenants no rights under the regulations admitting applicants to permanent housing. The record reveals that tenants were afforded an ample opportunity to prove their claims which the court resolved against them as a matter of credibility. We find no reason to disturb said determinations.
Inasmuch as no issue is raised as to the August 31, 2001 order, we affirm same.

Walter B. Tolub, J.
This is a CPLR article 78 proceeding by which the petitioners seek (1) to enjoin respondents the Mayor, the New York City Police Department (hereinafter NYPD), and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly from continuing the construction of a permanent closure of Park Row below its intersection with Worth Street without undertaking an environmental analysis as mandated by New York’s State Environmental Quality Review Act (hereinafter SEQRA; ECL art 8) and 6 NYCRR part 617, and (2) to enjoin respondents from using James Madison Plaza as a parking lot for NYPD vehicles. Petitioners Chatham Green, Inc. and Chatham Towers, Inc. are cooperative apartment buildings located on Park Row that claim their members will be adversely affected by a permanent closure of Park Row.
For the reasons stated herein petitioners’ motion is granted in part. Respondents are ordered to conduct an environmental assessment (hereinafter EA) to determine whether an environmental impact statement (hereinafter EIS) is required, and are enjoined, effective December 31, 2003, from continuing to use James Madison Plaza as a parking lot for NYPD vehicles.
Because the two actions arise out of different sets of facts and present different issues of law, they are discussed separately below.
Park Row Barriers
Facts
In the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, the NYPD conducted security assessments and implemented various measures throughout New York City to respond to security concerns related to the threat of terrorism. In assessing the security of NYPD headquarters located at One Police Plaza, the NYPD’s Counter-Terrorism Division concluded that the temporary “secure zone” created around the building immediately following the terrorist attacks should be maintained to prevent the possibility of a vehicle bomb attack on police headquarters. In order to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering the secure zone and to allow authorized vehicles to enter the secure zone, the NYPD set up checkpoints and temporary barriers at seven points around NYPD headquarters. One of the checkpoints is on Park Row at Worth Street, immediately before the entrance to the driveway of the Chatham Green apartment complex. One cannot access the Chatham Green driveway without passing through the checkpoint. The NYPD established this checkpoint “because the end of the Chatham Green driveway is located immediately adjacent to an area of police headquarters that contains critical infrastructure and personnel. A car bomb attack at this location would cause widespread harm to police personnel and property and would severely compromise certain police functions and infrastructure” (Dobbins affidavit 1110).
At the time of this motion, the Park Row checkpoint at issue consisted of temporary concrete barriers and two NYPD patrol cars, which blocked the vehicle entrance to Park Row and which were moved to allow authorized vehicles to pass through {id.). The NYPD indicated at the time that they planned to soon install and make operational “Delta Barriers” at the checkpoint. Delta Barriers are barriers that sit on the road and may be lowered by a police officer stationed at the checkpoint to allow only authorized vehicles to pass through. As of this date the Delta Barriers have been installed and are operational at the checkpoint. The NYPD did not conduct an EA prior to the installation of the barriers.
The NYPD has developed a plan for restricted vehicular access through the checkpoint “(a) requiring drivers who are residents to provide valid identification, (b) requiring drivers who are guests to identify the person they are visiting, (c) requiring taxi, livery, and Access-A-Ride drivers to identify the name and apartment number of the resident they are picking up, and (d) requiring delivery vehicle drivers to identify the recipient of their deliveries. As has been the case in the past, emergency vehicles will be allowed to pass through the checkpoints without stopping” (Leung affidavit 1111).
Petitioners claim that the establishment of checkpoints, and the one at Park Row in particular, has adversely affected their ability to enter and exit their complexes. More significantly, it has increased traffic congestion and pollution on neighboring streets. Specifically, they claim that
“the members of the Co-op would be immediately and directly affected by the increased noise, pollution, congestion, traffic, pedestrian congestion, strain on mass transit, loss of business revenue, loss of use of their property, and stress on other neighborhood facilities and resources such as [police], emergency vehicles, transportation agencies and sanitation as a result of the permanent closure at the site” (amended verified petition 1ÍH 4, 6).
Discussion
CPLR 7803 (3) provides for limited judicial review of administrative actions, stating in part:
“The only questions that may be raised in a proceeding under this article are . . . whether a determination was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion, including abuse of discretion as to the measure or mode of penalty or discipline imposed.”
Petitioners claim that respondents’ installation of street barriers without conducting the review mandated by SEQRA is in violation of lawful procedure and is arbitrary and capricious.
SEQRA provides that “All agencies . . . shall prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract or otherwise an environmental impact statement on any action they propose or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment” (ECL 8-0109 [2]). “As early as possible in the formulation of a proposal for an action, the responsible agency shall make an initial determination whether an environmental impact statement need be prepared for the action” (ECL 8-0109 [4]).
SEQRA delegates to the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) the adoption of rules and regulations for implementation of SEQRA (ECL 8-0113). The administrative rules implementing SEQRA divide actions into type I, type II, and unlisted actions (6 NYCRR part 617). A type I action carries the presumption that it is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and may require an EIS (6 NYCRR 617.4 [a] [1]). Type II actions have been determined by the DEC to not have a significant adverse impact on the environment and are not subject to environmental impact review (6 NYCRR 617.5 [a]). Unlisted actions, i.e., actions not listed as type I or type II, must undergo an EA to determine if the action may have a significant adverse environmental impact (6 NYCRR 617.6 [a] [3]). If an agency determines that its action may include the potential for at least one significant adverse environmental impact, an EIS is required (6 NYCRR 617.7 [a] [1]). For an agency to find that an EIS is not required, it must determine that its action will not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts (6 NYCRR 617.7 [a] [2]). Petitioners contend that the installation of barriers is an unlisted action requiring an EA. Respondents argue that the installation of barriers falls under actions listed as type II actions. Specifically, respondents argue that the installation of barriers falls into the categories of “installation of traffic control devices on existing streets, roads and highways” (6 NYCRR 617.5 [c] [16]), and “minor temporary uses of land having negligible or no permanent impact on the environment” (6 NYCRR 617.5 [c] [15]).
The issue of whether “traffic control devices” under 6 NYCRR 617.5 (c) (16) includes barriers used to restrict street access is a matter of first impression. The DEC implementing rules do not define traffic control devices.
The DEC sets out 37 actions which are type II actions and do not require review (6 NYCRR 617.5 [c]). These actions have been determined not to have a significant impact on the environment, or are otherwise exempt from review by law (6 NYCRR 617.5 [a]). Installation of traffic control devices on existing streets is an action that was determined not to have a significant impact on the environment.
It is this court’s opinion that barriers restricting access to a road are not traffic control devices within the meaning of 6 NYCRR 617.5 (c) (16). Traffic control devices, such as signs, signals, and lane markings, generally do not have significant impact on the routing of traffic. While the implementation of traffic signals at an intersection can affect the flow of traffic, they are unlikely to cause changes in traffic patterns.
The installation of barriers that restrict access to a heavily traveled road is an action of a different nature than the installation of traffic devices on existing streets, roads and highways. Rather than guiding or warning traffic, the barriers exclude the majority of drivers from the use of Park Row between Worth Street and the Brooklyn Bridge. Unlike the installation of traffic signs or signals, the installation of barriers has the potential to cause changes in traffic patterns, resulting in increased traffic, noise, air pollution, and stress on neighborhood facilities.
Not every traffic installation is so administrative, routine or ministerial in nature so as to warrant its classification as type II (Town of Bedford v White, 155 Misc 2d 68, 71 [Sup Ct, Westchester County 1992], affd 202 AD2d 557 [2d Dept 1994]). In some cases a traffic installation “could, if not properly reviewed, have global impacts” (id.). The installation of barriers at Park Row is potentially such a case. Petitioners argue that the installation of barriers and the restrictions on the use of Park Row have caused changes in traffic patterns throughout the surrounding area, and the court finds this to be a reasonably possible result of the action. Such changes may potentially impact the environment. In fact, a potential change in traffic patterns is specifically listed as one factor to be considered in an EA (6 NYCRR 617.20, Appendix C). Therefore it is this court’s opinion that the DEC did not intend for the classification of “installation of traffic control devices on existing streets, roads and highways” (6 NYCRR 617.5 [c] [16]) to include the installation of barriers that exclude most drivers from using a public street.
Respondents contend that the barriers do not close off the street completely, but rather allow certain vehicles access upon presentment of proof that they are using the road for an authorized purpose. While the court recognizes that this is indeed true, the barriers do close off the street to the vast majority of drivers who would wish to use Park Row. As such, it is possible that the barriers may potentially reroute traffic, and in doing so, adversely affect the environment. Such an action is not within the meaning of a type II installation of traffic devices since it may potentially have a significant impact on the environment.
Respondents also argue that the barriers fall under the type II category of “minor temporary uses of land having negligible or no permanent impact on the environment” (6 NYCRR 617.5 [c] [15]). The court finds this claim unavailing. While respondents assert that the barriers are not permanent and may be removed if the threat of a terrorist attack against One Police Plaza is reduced, they offer no estimation of when, if ever, that will be. While it is the court’s deep and sincere hope that the threat of a terrorist attack against One Police Plaza will be significantly reduced in the near future, it is the court’s expectation that the threat will remain for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, even assuming arguendo that the barriers are temporary, barriers that deny most drivers access to a public street are not minor, and the degree to which they impact the environment is more properly addressed by conducting an EA.
Relief
Petitioners seek an injunction against respondents’ development and installation of Delta Barriers at the checkpoint the NYPD established on Park Row below Worth Street without undertaking the environmental analysis mandated by SEQRA and 6 NYCRR part 617. As of this date, the Delta Barriers have been installed at the Chatham Green location and are currently operational.
SEQRA requires that an EA be performed before the action at issue is taken. As a general rule, once a violation of SEQRA has been shown, the proper remedy is to annul any agency determinations that do not comply with SEQRA and to enjoin any actions arising out of such determinations (Chinese Staff & Workers Assn. v City of New York, 68 NY2d 359 [1986]; Golden v Metropolitan Transp. Auth., 126 AD2d 128 [2d Dept 1987]).
However, under certain circumstances it may not be appropriate to enjoin an action that was taken in noncompliance with SEQRA. Where enjoining an action or requiring that an action be undone would likely cause irreparable harm to respondents, and the balance of equities is in favor of the respondents, it is not appropriate to do so (Golden at 132, 133; Spring-Gar Community Civic Assn. v Homes for Homeless, 135 Misc 2d 689, 698 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1987]; West 97th-W. 98th Sts. Block Assn. v Volunteers of Am. of Greater N.Y., 153 Misc 2d 321, 331 [Sup Ct, NY County 1991], affd in part and mod in part on other grounds 190 AD2d 303 [1st Dept 1993]). In such a case the court may order the agency to conduct an EA while allowing the agency to maintain the action (see Spring-Gar at 698, 699; Golden at 132, 133; Silvercup Studios v Power Auth. of State of N.Y., 285 AD2d 598, 601 [2d Dept 2001]; Uprose v Power Auth. of State of N.Y., 285 AD2d 603, 608 [2d Dept 2001]).
In light of the fact that the barriers are in place as a security measure to prevent a terrorist attack against One Police Plaza, the balance of equities and the potential for irreparable harm compel this court not to order that the barriers be taken out of operation until the environmental analysis is complete. Furthermore, since petitioners’ motion seeks to enjoin an action that has since taken place, it is not clear whether petitioners would seek that the action be undone. Indeed, petitioners are unclear as to whether they seek enjoinment of the NYPD’s security measures while an environmental assessment is conducted.
Accordingly, the court orders that respondents undertake an EA to determine if an EIS is required, and that an EIS be performed if the EA determines that one is required. Respondents may maintain the barriers while the EA, and if required the EIS, are performed, provided that the EA is completed within 90 days of service of this order with notice of entry, and the EIS, if required, is completed within six months of the completion of the EA.
James Madison Plaza
Petitioners’ second cause of action alleges that by occupying and converting James Madison Plaza into a parking lot, the respondents have acted unlawfully and in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Petitioners seek an injunction prohibiting the NYPD from any infringement upon the park. For the reasons stated herein, petitioners’ motion for injunctive relief is granted to the extent indicated below.
Facts
James Madison Plaza is a triangular piece of land bordered by St. James Street, Madison Street, and Pearl Street. The land was deeded to the City of New York in 1964 as part of the Chatham Green Towers project (City of New York/Parks & Recreation, James Madison Plaza [July 2001] <www. nycgo vparks. org/sub_y our_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_ sign.php?id=11250> [accessed Oct. 29, 2003]). It came under the jurisdiction of the City of New York Parks and Recreation Department that same year (id.).
The plaza, which comprises .361 acres, is currently paved and there are no benches or other fixtures on it. Trees and planters surround its edges. Metal and concrete barriers effectively enclose the park’s perimeter. This court is uncertain as to any other configuration of the plaza that may have existed prior to 2001.
The plaza lies across from One Police Plaza, the headquarters of the NYPD. Since September 2001, the plaza has been used as a parking lot for police officers’ private vehicles. There is a manned police booth on the plaza’s corner, where Madison and Pearl Streets intersect. The booth controls vehicular access to the plaza.
Discussion
Petitioners claim per CPLR 7803 (3) that the NYPD’s occupation and use of James Madison Plaza is arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful, because without legislative approval the use of a park for a nonpark purpose constitutes an impermissible alienation of parkland (amended verified petition at 9). The NYPD contends that while the parking of police vehicles in the plaza is a “non-park use” of parkland, its occupation of the plaza is temporary, and therefore no legislative approval of its action is required.
The New York Court of Appeals addressed the issue of parkland alienation in Williams v Gallatin (229 NY 248 [1920] [New York City Commissioner of Parks prohibited from entering into a voidable 10-year lease with a quasi-public agency for the Central Park Arsenal building]), and that case remains the controlling precedent in this state. (See Friends of Van Cortlandt Park v City of New York, 95 NY2d 623, 629 [2001].) In Williams, the Court explained that “[a] park is a pleasure ground set apart for recreation of the public, to promote its health and enjoyment ... no objects, however worthy . . . should be permitted to encroach upon it without legislative authority plainly conferred” (Williams at 253, citing in part Perrin v New York Cent. R.R. Co., 36 NY 120, 124 [1867]). Eighty years later, in Van Cortlandt Park, the same Court stated that “Williams makes clear that legislative approval is required when there is a substantial intrusion on parkland for non-park purposes . . . regardless of whether the parkland is ultimately to be restored” (Van Cortlandt Park at 630). Furthermore, “our law is well settled: dedicated park areas in New York are impressed with a public trust for the benefit of the people of the State” {id. at 631). Their “use for other than park purposes, either for a period of years or permanently, requires the direct and specific approval of the State Legislature, plainly conferred” (id. at 632, citing Ackerman v Steisel, 104 AD2d 940, 941 [2d Dept 1984] [use of parkland by Highways and Sanitation Departments for storage of vehicles and equipment for 25 and 14 years, respectively, improper because not “temporary”]).
The language of Ackerman and Van Cortlandt Park thus delineates both the rule and its exception: legislative approval is not required when the nonpark use of a park is temporary, i.e., not “for a period of years” or not “permanent.”
The definition of “temporary” varies with the context of the case (see Ackerman; see also Bates v Holbrook, 171 NY 460 [1902] [although the City Department of Parks had legislative approved to grant “temporary privileges” for use of park property to facilitate subway construction, the Court found structures could not be considered “temporary” when project would take three years to complete]; Van Cortlandt Park at 631 [five-year park closure for important underground public project requires legislative approval; dicta by the Court of Appeals stating that while “de minimis” exceptions from the public trust doctrine may exist, the case did not require the Court to draw specific lines at that time]).
The NYPD, in claiming that its “non-park use” of James Madison Plaza is temporary, states that there is “no bright line between when a non-park use is temporary and when it becomes permanent” (respondents’ mem of law at 15, citing Wetter v Moses, 86 NYS2d 110 [1941], affd 265 App Div 993 [1st Dept 1943] [park’s closure permissible during construction of Brooklyn Battery Tunnel; construction took three years]).
The NYPD’s reliance upon Wetter for the proposition that Battery Park’s closure was permissible because it was “temporary” is misplaced. In Wetter, the City allowed the New York City Tunnel Authority to use certain property in Battery Park during the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. The Mayor designated the Parks Commissioner to coordinate the work, and in this capacity the Commissioner decided to close the park area. The court’s decision does not make it clear whether or not legislative approval was given for these actions. However, in upholding the Commissioner’s decision, the court found that by closing the park the Commissioner acted for safety reasons in the public interest and therefore did not abuse his discretion (id. at 112).
Justice Valente’s use of the word “temporary” in Wetter does not refer to the park’s closure. It is used in reference to the temporary abrogation of a contract between the City and the New York Zoological Society, both respondents in the action. The court did not permit the park’s closure because it was “temporary”; it permitted the park’s closure because given the particular circumstances of the case, the closure was in the public interest and within the discretion of the Parks Commissioner as he discharged his official duties.
The Wetter decision does not mention the public trust doctrine elucidated 21 years earlier in Williams. The doctrine, however, governs in this state (see Van Cortlandt Park at 629). Furthermore, the court finds the NYPD’s explanation of its “temporary” occupation of James Madison Plaza questionable.
The NYPD claims its occupation of the plaza is necessary due to a severe parking shortage in the vicinity of One Police Plaza (verified answer at 12). This shortage is “in part due to the closure in 2001 of the Municipal Garage located at 109-113 Park Row” (respondents’ mem of law at 16). The court again notes that this occupation apparently preceded the emergency measures of September 11, 2001. The NYPD states that “when the Municipal Garage reopens” it will remove all vehicles from the plaza (id.).
The court would respectfully draw to the respondents’ attention that on June 29, 2001 the Police Commissioner closed the municipal garage in question (see Fields v Giuliani, 2001 NY Slip Op 40315[U]), and the court assumes that the garage remains under the respondents’ control.
While not questioning the NYPD’s initial motives in closing the municipal garage at 109-113 Park Row, the court does question the respondent NYPD’s 23-month long occupation and conversion of the park into a parking lot. Given that the respondents control the means to end its occupation, the NYPD’s use of the plaza appears to be more “convenient” than “temporary.”
The court finds the respondent NYPD’s occupation of James Madison Plaza is violative of the common-law doctrine of the public trust, and hence unlawful. As the NYPD’s occupation of the plaza is a “substantial intrusion on parkland for non-park purposes,” legislative approval of its nonpark use is required.
Parks are created as pleasure grounds and set apart for the recreation of the public. Parks are not created to provide free parking.
Accordingly, it is ordered that respondents are enjoined from using James Madison Plaza for parking. However, and in order to permit respondents to seek legislative approval, the injunction is stayed until December 31, 2003; and it is further ordered that respondents undertake an environmental assessment with regard to the Delta Barriers on Park Row to determine whether an environmental impact statement is required; and it is further ordered that during the pendency of the environmental assessment and if required the environmental impact statement, respondents may maintain the existing Delta Barriers; and it is further ordered that the environmental assessment shall be completed within 90 days of service of this order with notice of entry; and it is further ordered that if an environmental impact statement is required, the environmental impact statement shall be completed within six months of the completion of the environmental assessment.
. Petitioners also raise a claim under the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR; 62 RCNY chs 5, 6). As noted by petitioners, the CEQR rules implement SEQRA in New York City and are essentially the same as the SE-QRA rules (petitioners’ mem of law, at 7 n 4). There are no provisions of CEQR that differ from SEQRA in any manner relevant to this action.
. Compare “an environmental assessment will in no way interfere with existing security measures, which may continue while the assessment proceeds” (petitioners’ mem of law at 10) with “the security measures that respondents have implemented should be enjoined unless and until the City undertakes a formal environmental assessment in accordance with SEQRA” {id.).
. It is important to note that the NYPD does not claim that its occupation of James Madison Plaza is connected in any way to the aforementioned “secure zone.” The only explanation given by the NYPD for the park’s occupation is the parking shortage caused in part by the closing of the municipal garage at 109-113 Park Row (respondents’ verified answer at 5; respondents’ mem of law at 15-17).",0
0261-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Robert F. Julian, J.
relief requested: Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on liability pursuant to Labor Law § 240.
holding: Motion granted. Plaintiff fell from an elevated work site which was not provided with required safety devices, and the defendant is liable as a matter of law pursuant to Labor Law § 240.
discussion: Plaintiff Theodore Fox, Jr. was injured on October 10, 2002 when a pedestrian bridge then being constructed over and as part of the new Utica-Rome Expressway in Marcy, New York, collapsed, causing Fox to fall over 30 feet and sustain serious injuries. Fox was an employee of the New York State Department of Transportation, and was then in the course of performing his employment duties. At the time of the accident the bridge was incomplete, and work was proceeding on it, specifically the pouring of concrete for the deck of the bridge. Plaintiff provides the affidavits and curriculum vitae of a professional engineer, Stanley J. Filipek, PE, concerning the accident. Mr. Filipek opines that the intended finished concrete deck was an integral part of the structural system of the bridge; that the bridge was not structurally sound until the hardened concrete deck was in place (and, specifically, because it lacked adequate torsional resistance); that the presence of the workmen, finishing machine, and wet concrete caused unbalanced loads on the uncompleted bridge, which did not have sufficient structural integrity to withstand the forces involved in the process of pouring the concrete, and hence collapsed. Mr. Filipek states that appropriate bracing (shoring), a safety device defined in Labor Law § 240, would have prevented the collapse and hence the fall.
The court is provided no reason or fact by the defendant why it should not accept the aforementioned allegations and professional conclusions as true and correct. No factual dispute is suggested by defendant. No expert opinion is offered to suggest that proper shoring might not have mattered (thus questioning proximate cause), or, more broadly (and necessarily), that there was no suitable safety device which would have provided proper protection to the workers. The only criticism offered of Mr. Filipek’s affidavits is that they are conclusory; we are indeed not offered all the facts underlying the opinions, and those omitted might indeed be relevant if there were some theory presented by the defense that would, even conceivably, call these conclusions into question. But none of the conclusions are substantively challenged and they are professional opinions based on undisputed facts and would at trial be sufficient evidence to place this matter before a jury.
All the defendant offers in opposition is that discovery — which has not been had, and which defendant says it needs — will show that “Labor Law 240 does not apply to the subject occurrence since the record will establish that the bridge was meant to be permanent in nature” (defendant’s mem of law, filed July 15, 2003). The defendant cannot conceivably require discovery to set forth prima facie (and undoubtedly absolutely irrefutable) proof of that claim. It is the contractor that was building the bridge. Is the defendant actually telling us that it needs discovery to know whether or not the structure it was building was permanent? On oral argument the defendant asserted that discovery, including still incomplete reports from the State of New York and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, was needed to find out why the bridge collapsed. Yet no showing of any kind is made regarding why the specific mechanism of failure would be relevant to a Labor Law § 240 case. The issue, and only issue, is whether proper protection was provided to guard against gravity related hazards arising from work being performed at an elevated work site. How is the specific reason for the collapse germane to that inquiry? Or does the defendant have some remarkable theory of the collapse whereby no safety device could have prevented it? Because the plaintiff asserts that shoring was indicated and was not provided, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate either that the structure was completed or that the alleged missing safety device was not relevant.
On oral argument the defendant referred to other “unknowns” that might be alleviated by discovery. Counsel stated, “Is there another method that could have been used to build this bridge such that workers wouldn’t be standing on a structure that could collapse? I don’t know that there is another method or not.” The defendant contracted with the State of New York to build, this bridge on a public highway and thus is well situated to answer that question without discovery. The defendant’s failure to respond substantively speaks volumes. Further questioned on oral argument about what discovery would be relevant, defense counsel suggested (at 14) that discovery was needed to determine what work was being done on the bridge at the time, specifically regarding whether concrete was being poured, but then of course had to concede that Tioga knew what it was doing at the time of the accident. No further showing of the conceivable utility of discovery was made. Ruttura & Sons Constr. Co. v Petrocelli Constr. (257 AD2d 614, 615 [2d Dept 1999]) provides
“A determination of summary judgment cannot be avoided by a claimed need for discovery unless some evidentiary basis is offered to suggest that discovery may lead to relevant evidence (see, Auerbach v Bennett, 47 NY2d 619; see also, Carrington v City of New York, 201 AD2d 525; Kennerly v Campbell Chain Co., 133 AD2d 669).” (See also Vidal v Tsitsiashvili, 297 AD2d 638 [2d Dept 2002].)
The defendant is simply unable to articulate anything which it does not know, but might find out, that would be relevant to a determination under section 240. The bridge fell down because of a design failure, or a materials failure, or a construction failure, or some combination of the three. In any case, there was no proper protection (shoring, bracing, stays) provided to those working on this elevated work site. It is of the utmost significance and importance to the court’s determination herein that the defendant Tioga Construction Company, Inc., the builder of the collapsed bridge, is unable to articulate even the semblance of a defense to a section 240 claim which would be substantiated by discovery. The only negligence defense expressed is that the bridge was improperly designed by the State of New York. While that may well be relevant to the question of who is ultimately to bear the cost of this tragic debacle, it is utterly irrelevant to Tioga’s nondelegable duty to provide proper protection for workers.
Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant must raise a triable issue of fact relating to the prima facie case or to the plaintiff’s credibility to defeat the motion for summary judgment. (Klein v City of New York, 89 NY2d 833 [1996].) If the defendant can show that facts exist which would support opposition, but they are not presently available to it, discovery can be had pursuant to CPLR 3212 (f). (See Bingham v Wells, Rich, Greene, 34 AD2d 924 [1st Dept 1970].) As shown above, the defendant cannot and does not show such facts.
There is no factual defense in this matter and there are no factual disputes. Defendant’s more substantial defense against summary judgment lies in whether section 240 covers the collapse of a partially completed structure, the components of which and the structure itself are intended to be permanent, which structure is at the same time being used as an elevated work platform upon which, in this case, to execute the several tasks required to build what may be properly called a “bridge.” Accordingly, we turn to the statute and cases:
Labor Law “§ 240. Scaffolding and other devices for use of employees
“1. All contractors and owners and their agents, except owners of one and two-family dwellings who contract for but do not direct or control the work, in the erection, demolition, repairing, altering, painting, cleaning or pointing of a building or structure shall furnish or erect, or cause to be furnished or erected for the performance of such labor, scaffolding, hoists, stays, ladders, slings, hangers, blocks, pulleys, braces, irons, ropes, and other devices which shall be so constructed, placed and operated as to give proper protection to a person so employed.”
There is no dispute that defendant Tioga is a “contractor” under the statute. There is no dispute that Tioga was in the course of “erection” of a “structure” when and where the complained of injuries occurred. There is no dispute that plaintiff was “employed” in the construction of the structure and lawfully on the premises in the course of his employment when the accident happened. There is no dispute that plaintiff fell some 30 feet and was injured when the bridge twisted and collapsed while concrete was being poured on the bridge. There can be no dispute that this occurrence falls within the range of section 240 covered accidents envisioned in Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co. (81 NY2d 494, 501 [1993]): “Labor Law § 240 (1) was designed to prevent those types of accidents in which the scaffold . . . ladder or other protective device proved inadequate to shield the injured worker from harm directly flowing from the application of the force of gravity to an object or person.” The question then is whether Tioga “furnish[ed] or erect[ed], or cause[d] to be furnished or erected for the performance of such labor, scaffolding, hoists, stays, ladders, slings, hangers, blocks, pulleys, braces, irons, ropes, and other devices ... so constructed, placed and operated as to give proper protection to a person so employed.” Plaintiff alleges that, as a matter of law, it did not, and that he is therefore entitled to summary judgment on his Labor Law § 240 cause of action. Plaintiff alleges that there were no safety devices provided, and that required temporary shoring was not present to provide proper protection to plaintiff. Defendant does not dispute the absence of shoring or other safety devices. Rather, the defendant argues that the collapse of the bridge was not the collapse of a scaffold or temporary device of the sort covered by section 240 but was rather the collapse of the uncompleted but permanent structure itself and thus not amenable to section 240 treatment.
In deciding this matter the court is mindful of the principles set forth in Gordon v Eastern Ry. Supply (82 NY2d 555, 559 [1993]) concerning section 240 (1) of the Labor Law, often referred to as the “scaffold law”:
“The purpose of the section is to protect workers by placing the ‘ultimate responsibility’ for worksite safety on the owner and general contractor, instead of the workers themselves (see, Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., 81 NY2d 494, 500; Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., 78 NY2d 509, 513; 1969 NY Legis Ann, at 407). Thus, section 240 (1) imposes absolute liability on owners, contractors and their agents for any breach of the statutory duty which has proximately caused injury (Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., 78 NY2d, at 513, supra). The duty imposed is ‘nondelegable and ... an owner is liable for a violation of the section even though the job was performed by an independent contractor over which it exercised no supervision or control’ (id., at 513; see also, Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., 81 NY2d, at 500, supra; Haimes v New York Tel. Co., 46 NY2d 132, 136-137). We have noted ‘that section 240 (1) “ ‘is to be construed as liberally as may be for the accomplishment of the purpose for which it was thus framed’ ” ’ (Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., 78 NY2d, at 513, supra [quoting Quigley v Thatcher, 207 NY 66, 68]).”
And of the Court of Appeals emphasis in Misseritti v Mark IV Constr. Co. (86 NY2d 487, 490-491 [1995]) on the point that
“Section 240, known as the ‘Scaffold Law,’ has historically been construed in the context of workers injured as a result of inadequate or missing safety equipment at elevated work sites . . . It is in recognition of the exceptionally dangerous conditions posed by elevation differentials at work sites that section 240 (1) prescribes safety precautions for workers laboring under unique gravity-related hazards . . . .”
And the holdings of Zimmer v Chemung County Performing Arts (65 NY2d 513, 524 [1985]), that once it is determined that the owner or contractor failed to provide the necessary safety devices required to give a worker “proper protection,” absolute liability is “unavoidable” under section 240 (1), and that in “the absence of any safety devices at the worksite, the statute’s clear dictates have not been met.”
Defendant references several decisions in which the collapse of a permanent structure was deemed outside the scope of Labor Law § 240 and which thus, it says, requires denial of the motion here. In Dombrowski v Schwartz (217 AD2d 914 [4th Dept 1995]), a permanent stairway was placed in its proper location but not anchored or affixed. A workman attempting to climb it was caused to fall 10 feet. The Appellate Division held (at 914) that “The record establishes that the stairway was permanent and not temporary in nature, thereby precluding consideration of it either as the functional equivalent of a ladder or other statutorily enumerated safety device or as a tool used in the performance of plaintiff’s work” and denied section 240 applicability. In Sponholz v Benderson Prop. Dev. (266 AD2d 815 [4th Dept 1999]), a worker fell 12 to 15 feet when a stairway in a building undergoing renovation collapsed beneath him. The stairway had been a permanent passageway between parts of the building, did not constitute a “safety device,” and section 240 did not apply. In Misseritti v Mark IV Constr. Co. (86 NY2d 487 [1995]), a worker was killed when a completed concrete block fire wall collapsed on him. In finding that section 240 did not apply, the Court of Appeals found (at 491) that “In this context, we construe the ‘braces’ referred to in section 240 (1) to mean those used to support elevated work sites not braces designed to shore up or lend support to a completed structure.”
In Misseritti, the holding related to the fact that the accident did not happen at an elevated work site, and that the “braces” in question were not the safety devices relating to elevation hazards which the statute required. Here the work site was at an elevation of 30 feet, and it was elevation related safety devices that were missing.
Both Dombrowski and Sponholz refer to permanent structures from which some other permanent and necessary feature was missing, causing the accident. A permanent staircase is not a safety device intended to keep workers from falling during construction. The permanent fasteners which apparently were never placed in Dombrowski and were prematurely removed in Sponholz were not safety devices intended for worker safety, but were, rather, basic and permanent parts of the building. The plaintiffs in those cases were not complaining about the absence of a safety device, but rather about the absence of a structural component of the building.
This case does not involve a completed component inappropriately affixed and is not ruled by those cases. Rather, this case is determined by the ruling in Keefe v E & D Specialty Stands (259 AD2d 994 [4th Dept 1999]). The plaintiff Keefe was involved in the construction of bleachers, and was utilizing existing elements of the partially constructed bleachers as a stairway to move other seats into position. He fell. The defendant alleged, as does defendant herein, that the injury occurred on a permanent structure and that section 240 was not applicable. The Appellate Division held otherwise. In this context, the Court found that the bleachers were functioning as a temporary staircase, or as the functional equivalent of a ladder. “Because the riser was unsecured, the temporary stairway failed to give plaintiff proper protection from falling from an elevated workplace. So viewed, plaintiffs fall comes within the protection of Labor Law § 240.” (At 994.) This is very much the situation here. At the time of the accident the structure was only partially completed and in the midst of major, fundamental construction. In order that the work be done, workers, equipment, and materials had to be maintained at the height of the permanent structure. The structure itself was utilized for that purpose: it provided and was used as a temporary platform for its own construction. At the time of the occurrence, it was more scaffold than bridge; it could have functioned as a scaffold, had it been properly braced. Defendant concedes that it could not have functioned as a “bridge.” It was a place workers could go in order that they might build a bridge. The defendant’s point would have been well taken had construction reached the point at which this could have been called a substantially completed structure. A worker injured from the collapse of this bridge at a time when all that was left was to install pathway markings and signs would indeed not have had a section 240 claim, since no safety devices could then be deemed “missing.” But until this construction site became a substantially completed bridge, substantially able to perform its function, it was an elevated workplace which posed substantial risks of gravity related injury and was thus mandated to have such safety devices as would provide proper protection to the workers.
In Foufana v City of New York (211 AD2d 550 [1st Dept 1995]), a formerly permanent structure functioned as a temporary safety device when a stairway was inadvertently discovered and was left to function as a route from the bottom of an excavation to street level. It functioned as a ladder, it was unsafe, and section 240 was applicable. In Clute v Ellis Hosp. (184 AD2d 942 [3d Dept 1992]), a worker was injured when a roof deck upon which he was pouring concrete collapsed. The decking, a permanent part of the uncompleted roof, was functioning as a scaffold, other required temporary safety devices (braces) were not in place, and section 240 was applicable. (See also Dick v Gates, 146 AD2d 953 [3d Dept 1989].) In Richardson v Matarese (206 AD2d 353 [2d Dept 1994]), a section 240 violation was shown prima facie by the collapse of a floor, without regard to whether it was part of the permanent structure. Edholm v Smithtown DiCanio Org. (217 AD2d 569 [2d Dept 1995]) presents facts suggestive of the present situation. A worker was standing on roof trusses which collapsed because of excessive weight. Roof trusses are parts of the permanent structure, yet the absence of adequate safety devices to support the intended permanent parts during the course of construction was adequate to support a section 240 claim. (See also John v Baharestani, 281 AD2d 114 [1st Dept 2001].)
This court has done what the commentators to 1B NY PJI3d 987 (2001) request, which is to reexamine Clute, Dick, Richardson and Edholm in light of Misseritti (supra)-, we find them to be entirely applicable and unaffected by Misseritti. Misseritti does not involve the use of the structure itself as an elevated workplace or the nonuse of a required safety device or the provision of a defective safety device, which are the issues in the cited cases, and whose viability therefore appears intact. Misseritti dealt with risks unrelated to an elevated work site and unrelated to the failure to provide a safety device.
The distinction between Dombrowski and Sponholz on one hand and Keefe, Clute et al. on the other is found in the nature of what’s missing. In Keefe (as in the matter at bar) it is a properly installed but temporary safety device that, was not provided. In Dombrowski and Sponholz it is permanent parts of the building (screws, bolts, lags, etc.) that were missing and the absence of which were the proximate causes of the accidents. Misseritti is similar in finding that it was not an elevation related safety device that was missing or the lack of which caused the accident.
' If the structure in the case at bar was a permanent structure and the concrete merely incidental to the permanent shoring and stability of this structure, a proper professional opinion in response to this motion by the defendant contractor is required.
The rule which may be distilled from the statute and cases, as applicable here, is that when a structure is under construction, and incomplete, and is functioning as an elevated work site, it must be provided with adequate safety devices to eliminate the risks posed by the height differential. If the absence of such devices is the proximate cause of a fall, Labor Law § 240 liability will lie.
Plaintiff here states a prima facie case under Labor Law § 240. The defendant makes no showing of any facts which would dispute this or even the possibility of such facts existing but outside its knowledge. Its sole defense is legal, and rests on the correct legal proposition that the collapse of a poorly constructed completed structure will not result in section 240 liability. The structure herein was not completed, but rather was, at the time of the occurrence, an incomplete structure functioning as an elevated work platform lacking required safety devices. The plaintiff was not protected from the elevation related risks presented, and the defendant is liable for the resulting injuries pursuant to Labor Law § 240. Plaintiffs motion is granted.

0446-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Patricia E Satterfield, J.
Petitioner Settlement Capital Corporation (SCC) makes the instant application, pursuant to General Obligations Law, article 5, title 17, known as the Structured Settlement Protection Act (SSPA), for the approval of transfer of certain rights vested in Richard C. Ballos under a structured settlement funded by Metropolitan Property & Liability Insurance Company. Pursuant to a purchase and sales agreement executed by him on January 21, 2003, Ballos transferred to SCC his rights to $125,000 of the $225,000 annuity that will become payable to him on October 1, 2010, in consideration for a gross advance amount from SCC of $39,000, exclusive of any fees incurred by the transaction. An annual discount rate of 15.591% was used to determine the gross advance amount, and Ballos agreed to pay legal fees in the amount of $2,500, resulting in a final net advance amount of $36,500 or 29% of the $125,000 amount to be transferred.
General Obligations Law § 5-1706, entitled “Approval of transfers of structured settlement payment rights,” states the following:
“No direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights shall be effective and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement payment rights unless the transfer has been authorized in advance in a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction based upon express findings by such court that:
“(a) the transfer complies with the requirements of this title;
“(b) the transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependants; and whether the transaction, including the discount rate used to determine the gross advance amount and the fees and expenses used to determine the net advance amount, are fair • and reasonable;
“(c) the payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received such advice or knowingly waived such advice in writing;
“(d) the transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority; and
“(e) is written in plain language and in compliance with section 5-702 of this article.”
SSPA was adopted by the State Legislature to give greater protection to individuals either entering into a structured settlement agreement or negotiating to sell or transfer a periodic payment thereunder to a third party. At issue is whether approval of the proposed transfer would be consistent with the letter and spirit of SSPA.
The Hearing on the Petition
SSC’s petition for approval of Ballos’ proposed transfer came before this court on April 23, 2003. Ballos, whose claims for personal injuries earlier were resolved by structured settlement, offered testimony in support of the proposed transfer. Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement and annuity, Ballos became entitled to receive monthly lifetime payments and a series of deferred lump-sum payments pursuant to the following payment schedule:
October 1, 1995 $25,000.00
October 1, 2000 $50,000.00
October 1, 2005 $100,000.00
October 1, 2010 $225,000.00
At the hearing before this court, Dallos stated that he previously sold his rights to the October 1, 2005 scheduled payment. Should the application be granted, $100,000 would remain of the October 1, 2010 scheduled payment.
In support of the application for judicial approval of the proposed transfer, Dallos testified, and his affidavit in support reiterated, that he is a totally disabled father of two teenagers and is engaged to be married. He also testified that, in addition to the proceeds that are the subject of this transaction, he receives guaranteed monthly payments under his structured settlement that are sufficient to support his family; that he has applied for and hopes to receive monthly Social Security benefits of $1,036, and will be eligible in two years to collect a pension of $800 per month as a former employee of United Parcel Service. Although his affidavit sets forth that one of the reasons he required an immediate transfer of funds is to preserve his home, Mr. Dallos testified at the hearing that his home was no longer in jeopardy of foreclosure, but he still needed money to improve his familial living status; consolidate debt; pay for the funeral expenses of his mother-in-law, whose death allegedly was imminent; purchase health insurance; and pay for medical treatment.
Jeffrey Calabrese, Esq., counsel for SCC, argued in support of the application, asserting that the transfer is in the best interest of Mr. Dallos because he is seeking to transfer only a portion of his annuity payment, and has other means of support to meet his financial obligations. The moving papers, as well as Dallos’ testimony, allege that Dallos understands the terms of the proposed transfer and is of a maturity and intelligence to make financial decisions that are in his best interest. Mr. Calabrese argues that because the annual discount rate of 15.591% is competitive and considerably below the prevailing rate of 19.5% the proposed transfer is in the best interest of Mr. Dallos, and should be approved by the court.
Discussion
The plain language of General Obligations Law § 5-1706 sets forth several procedural mandates that must be adhered to as a condition precedent to judicial approval of an application for transfer of a structured settlement to a third party. Equally significant, the statute mandates that the court, in determining such an application, make a two-prong inquiry based upon considerations of prudence, equity and reason, and vests in the court the authority to make an independent discretionary determination as to whether “the transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependants; and whether the transaction, including the discount rate used to determine the gross advance amount and the fees and expenses used to determine the net advance amount, are fair and reasonable.” (General Obligations Law § 5-1706 [b].)
The record before this court establishes that the petition and supporting papers are in compliance with the procedural mandates enumerated under the SSPA. A copy of the notice of petition and petition were served upon all interested parties at least 20 days before April 16, 2003, the time at which the petition was noticed to be heard (General Obligations Law § 5-1705 [c] ). Further, the petition contained a copy of the transfer agreement, the disclosure statement and the requisite proof of notice of that statement, and a listing of each of Ballos’ dependents, together with their ages. (General Obligations Law § 5-1705 [d] .) SCC made all written disclosures in the manner called for by statute and delivered them to Ballos on November 18, 2002, more than 10 days prior to the date he signed the transfer agreement (General Obligations Law § 5-1703). Having satisfied the procedural requirements, this court must scrutinize the proposed transfer, applying the two-pronged “best interest” and “fair and reasonable” test.
1. Application of the “Best Interest” Standard
The only guidance available to this court in determining whether the transfer meets the best interest standard is the legislative intent underlying enactment of the SSPA, the sparse case law applying the statutory provision since its 2002 enactment, evolving case law in other jurisdictions with similar statutes, and other learned treatises addressing transfer acts. The handful of New York cases that have addressed the instant issue, while invoking equitable considerations, do not expressly establish a specific standard to apply in evaluating “best interest” within the context of the statute; however, the express legislative intent of the enactment was to limit “transfers of structured settlement payments to true hardship cases.” (Legislative Mem in Support, 2002 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 2036.)
At the time of the enactment of SSPA, similar statutes already had been enacted in other jurisdictions to protect the recipients of long-term structured settlements from being victimized by companies aggressively seeking the acquisition of their rights. Decisional law that has evolved in some of those jurisdictions reflects an emerging bright line for determining whether proposed assignments of rights under a structured settlement agreement are in the “best interest of the payee,” and the application of these “best interest” standards to proposed transfers of structured settlement rights in other jurisdictions has led to mixed results. (See, Cavallaro v SAFECO Assigned Benefits Co., 1999 WL 1126320, 1999 Conn Super LEXIS 3211 [rejecting application of payee, who was then unemployed and on Social Security benefits, and wanted the lump sum in order to buy a condominium, upon the finding that although payee’s desire to buy a home was “likely in his best interests,” the payee had “not shown a reason for the assignment that comport(ed) with the purpose of the statute, which is to provide emergency assistance to those payees of a structured settlement agreement that are in immediate financial need” (1999 WL at *9, 1999 Conn Super LEXIS at *27)]; Grieve v General Am. Life Ins. Co., 58 F Supp 2d 319, 324 [1999] [rejecting the proposed assignment, finding that plaintiff, who was in substantial financial need, was asking the court “to enforce a transaction which will place her in significantly greater financial need, by cutting her income stream in half for the next fifteen years”]; compare, Rumbin v Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 254 Conn 259, 757 A2d 526 [2000] [approving, “in the best interests of the plaintiff,” the proposed assignment to avert pending threat of foreclosure on plaintiff’s home]; Buchanan v American Mut. Life Ins. Co., 1999 WL 1081346, 1999 Conn Super LEXIS 3094 [approving, “in the best interests of the plaintiff,” the proposed assignment where a divorced father earning only $28,000 per year needed the immediate funds to pay off some $20,000 in debt, including child support, medical bills, housing expenses, and student loans; was being hounded by bill collectors and was unable to borrow money from banks or other sources]; In re Transfer of Structured Settlement Rights by Spinelli, 353 NJ Super 459, 472, 803 A2d 172, 179 [2002] [approving, “in the best interests of the plaintiff,” proposed transfer even though discount rate was very high, with the caveat that “the court by no means holds that the same conclusion would be reached for payees lacking Spinelli’s financial acumen”].) These decisions, in flushing out the “best interest” standard as applied to proposed transfer of structured settlement payments, clearly are consistent with the notion of “hardship,” as articulated in the Legislative Memorandum in Support of SSPA, which was enacted in New York State subsequent to these decisions.
One New York State decision has addressed the “best interest” standard within the context of SSPA. In Matter of Settlement Funding of N.Y. (195 Misc 2d 721, 725 [2003]), one of only two published decisions issued since the enactment of the SSPA in New York State, both of which were decided in Rensselaer County, the court rejected a proposed transfer as not being in the payee’s “best interest” because he was “not in such desperate straits.” In so doing, the court stated the following with respect to the “best interest” standard, as applied in an earlier, unreported decision (at 725):
“[T]he court recently approved a transfer with an unreasonably high interest rate based solely on the payee’s ‘best interest.’ In that case, the payee desperately needed cash to obtain life sustaining medical treatment for a loved one and had no other legitimate means of raising the money. The court concluded that in the face of a ‘life and death emergency’ the payee’s best interest could outweigh the fact that the transfer terms were not fair or reasonable.”
In the unreported decision, the court seemingly balanced the “best interest” prong against the “fair and unreasonable” prong, and determined that a “life and death emergency” would outweigh the fact that the transfer terms were not “fair and reasonable” and approved the transfer. A contrary result was reached in Matter of Settlement Funding of N.Y. (supra), in which “desperate straits” were lacking.
Matter of Settlement Capital Corp. (194 Misc 2d 711 [2003]), also arising out of Rensselaer County, the court took a different approach in its “best interest” assessment. There, petitioner Settlement Capital proposed to purchase $35,000 of the $81,165 payment due to the payee on April 25, 2007, at a net advance of $13,250, applying a discount rate of 18.621%. The payee indicated that she intended to use the $13,250 advance in order to pay her family’s credit card debt, which was in excess of $15,000. The petition was filed on January 7, 2003, and made returnable February 3, 2003, within less than three months of the payee’s receipt of her periodic payment in the amount of $40,000, payable on April 25, 2003. In addition to raising numerous concerns regarding the application, the court, in denying the petition, stated the following (194 Misc 2d 711, 713 [2003]):
“The timing of the application is significant because the papers do not adequately address very fundamental questions, to wit, (1) why is it necessary to pay off the credit card debt in full at this time? and (2) why is it that the payee cannot wait just a little longer (until Apr. 25, 2003) to utilize the next periodic payment ($40,000) to pay off her credit card debt? While the court recognizes that the payee would most certainly incur additional interest expense in awaiting the April 25, 2003 periodic payment, the court, in evaluating the instant application, is unable on the present record to conclude that the benefits of the proposed transaction would outweigh those to be gained simply by waiting a few months. Absent further information, the court is of the view that it cannot make a finding that the proposed agreement is in the best interest of the payee, ‘taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents’ (General Obligations Law § 5-1706 [b]).”
The finding that the proposed transfer was not in the “best interest” of the payee hinged upon the timing of the application and the inadequacy of the information provided.
Clearly, in the absence of a statutory definition of “best interests,” New York State courts are faced with the daunting challenge of defining “best interest” and determining whether a transfer in a particular case is in the payee’s best interest. The “hardship” limitation contained in the Legislative Memorandum in Support of SSPA gives rise to the temptation to adopt, as a general proposition, a “best interest” standard that bespeaks of “desperate or dire straits” or a “life or death emergency.” This court declines to adopt such a limited definition, influenced in part, by the rationale underlying the rejection by the Minnesota Court of Appeals in Settlement Capital Corp. v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (646 NW2d 550, 555 [2002]) of the trial court’s definition that limited “best interests to immediate health emergencies or other emergency circumstances.” In finding that the trial court too narrowly defined the definition of best interests, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reasoned (646 NW2d at 556):
“[T]he best interests determination involves a more global consideration of the facts, circumstances, and means of support available to the payee and his or her dependents. These considerations would include, among other case specific factors, the reasonable preference of the payee, in light of the payee’s age, mental capacity, maturity level, and stated purpose for the transfer.”
Although the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s denial of the petition on the ground that the payee failed to demonstrated that she received independent tax and financial advice regarding the transfer, it found (646 NW2d at 556)
“Lundgren is 21 years old and has no cognitive disabilities; she is married and has two- children; she and her spouse have regular employment; her injuries from the car accident are primarily scars and do not affect her ability to earn income; she intends to use [$15,000] of the lump-sum payment for a house down-payment she could not secure any other way [$11,500 to pay off a car loan, and the remainder to pay off miscellaneous bills and debts]; she understood the terms of the transfer and the use of the high discount rate for these transfers; and the high discount rate is standard for these transfers of structured settlements in a secondary market. No evidence suggested that Lundgren was unable to support her two children in the absence of the structured-settlement payments. Under these facts, we conclude that Lundgren has made a suffieient showing that the transfer is in her and her children’s best interests.”
The legislative history of the Minnesota statute revealed that the “best interest” language was employed in the statute, rather than such language as “imminent financial hardship.” In New York, the “best interest” language was employed in the statute, rather than “hardship.”
This court thus declines to limit “best interest” to indicia of “hardship,” and adopts a “more global consideration.” This court finds that the “best interest” standard under the SSPA requires a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the proposed transfer of structured settlement payments, which were designed to preserve the injured person’s long-term financial security, will provide needed financial rescue without jeopardizing or irreparably impairing the financial security afforded to the payee and his or her dependents by the periodic payments. After an independent analysis of decisional law in this and other jurisdictions, and consideration of the legislative history of SSPA, this court determines that the best interest prong should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, giving specific consideration to such factors as the payee’s age; mental and physical capacity; maturity level; ability to show sufficient income that is independent of the payments sought for transfer; capacity to provide for the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents; the need for medical treatment; the stated purpose for the transfer; and the demonstrated ability of the payee to appreciate the financial terms and consequences of the proposed transfer based upon truly independent legal and financial advice. Notwithstanding the express legislative intent of the enactment to limit “transfers of structured settlement payments to true hardship cases,” this court determines that hardship is only one factor to be considered, based upon well-documented evidence that the payee or a payee’s dependent is confronted with such economic hardship, desperate or dire straits or unanticipated family emergency that, in the absence of the proposed transfer, the payee would be subject to dire consequences, such as imminent loss of life, loss of a home or the financial collapse of the family.
Application of these factors to the instant case compels the conclusion that the proposed transfer in this case is not in the best interest of Ballos or his dependents. Although Ballos states in conclusory fashion, without any documentary support, that he needs the money to improve his familial living status, consolidate debt, and provide funeral arrangements for his dying mother-in-law, there is no showing of a “true hardship,” dire emergency or matter of life or death. His own testimony establishes that, in addition to the proceeds that are the subject of this transaction, he receives guaranteed monthly payments under his structured settlement that are sufficient to support his family, that he has applied and hopes to receive monthly Social Security benefits of $1,036, and will be eligible in two years to collect his pension of $800 per month as a former employee of UPS. Notwithstanding that he may be totally disabled, his current income would appear to meet his present needs and those of his two teenagers, who will desperately need the funds that Mr. Ballos is quickly dissipating, as evidenced by the fact that he already transferred his entire October 1, 2005 payment of $100,000. Clearly, it would not be in his teenaged children’s “best interests” for this court to grant the petition. Nor is this court satisfied that Ballos appreciates the financial terms and consequences of the proposed transfer, having elected not to consult with a financial or legal adviser other than counsel for SCC.
As previously set forth, the protections afforded by the SSPA vests this court with the authority to determine whether the transfer is in the best interest of the payee, and whether the transaction, including the discount rate and the fees and expenses, are fair and reasonable. Therefore, as the best interest standard is an independent query from the fair and reasonable standard, as a general proposition, the court’s inquiry could end here, since the statutory language speaks in the conjunctive rather than the disjunctive. This court will apply the two-prong analysis, nevertheless, in the interest of a full inquiry as to whether the petition comports with each of the statutory requirements.
2. “Fair and Reasonable” Standard
The Legislative Memorandum in Support of the justification for the SSPA acknowledged (2002 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 2036) that “[rjecently a growing number of factoring companies have used aggressive advertising, plus the allure of quick and easy cash, to induce settlement recipients to cash out future payments, often at substantial discounts, depriving victims and their families of the long-term financial security their structured settlements were designed to provide.” (See, supra n 1.) The “fair and reasonable” standard thus is directed at an evaluation of the discount rate applied against future settlement proceeds in a given case. Again, case law is sparse with respect to what constitutes a “fair and reasonable” discount rate. Matter of Settlement Capital Corp. (supra) and Matter of Settlement Funding of N.Y. (supra), which, as set forth above, are the only published decisions issued since the enactment of the SSPA in New York State. The court in each instance found it impossible to determine whether the discount rates contained in the respective petitions were “fair and reasonable,” within the meaning of SSPA.
In Matter of Settlement Capital Corp. (supra), the court, in denying the petition, stated the following (194 Misc 2d 711, 713 [2003]):
“Notably, as a part of its review, the court is required to make a finding that the proposed discount rate used to determine the gross advance amount is fair and reasonable (see, General Obligations Law § 5-1706 [b]) ... As noted, a discount rate of 18.621% has been applied against the $35,000 figure to arrive at a gross advance amount of $15,750. No explanation has been presented as to why this particular discount rate was selected and/or why it should be deemed fair and reasonable. In the absence of such evidence, the court is of the view that it is unable to make the required statutory finding.”
In Matter of Settlement Funding of N.Y (supra), petitioner Settlement L.L.C. sought to transfer a portion of Mr. Cunningham’s structured settlement worth $151,701.75 at a discounted rate of $75,000. In denying the application, the court stated (195 Misc 2d 721, 723):
“The effective interest rate of the advance, if it is treated as a loan, is 15.46%. That interest rate is more than two and a half times the current low mortgage interest rate of 4.8% on a 20-year mortgage and approximates the interest rates on unsecured loans and credit card debt . . . Settlement L.L.C. attempts to justify the 15.46% interest rate by declaring that it is entitled to determine the rate at which it will lend money, its interest rate on this transaction falls within the range of what is presently being charged in the ‘market’ for structured settlement transfers, and Cunningham deems the interest rate acceptable. Assuming for the purposes of the argument that all three points are true, none of them is relevant to the question of whether 15.46% is ‘fair and reasonable.’ ”
The court continued (at 724):
“The SSPA clearly reflects the Legislature’s dissatisfaction with the structured settlement transfer market rates, and its conclusion that payees cannot protect their best interest and thus require judicial supervision. Settlement L.L.C.’s assurance that 15.46% is lower than the interest rates prior to the SSPA’s enactment does not logically compel a finding that the market rates have already dropped to the level of ‘fair and reasonable.’ Finally, the payee’s willingness has no bearing on the courts’ determination of whether the rate is ‘fair and reasonable.’ “Settlement L.L.C. has not demonstrated that these loans are, in practice, riskier than other types of secured loans. Settlement L.L.C. gives no concrete basis for expecting to be embroiled in future litigation with Cunningham, his creditors, and/or the bankruptcy court. Settlement L.L.C. makes no specific complaint about the solvency of the structured settlement obligor, Safeco Assigned Benefits Service Company and Safeco Life Insurance Company. While insurance companies have defaulted, Settlement L.L.C.’s general observations regarding potential risks are simply too speculative to justify its demand for 15.46% interest. Indeed, if structured settlements actually are as risky as Settlement L.L.C. suggests, then the courts should immediately stop approving them in the first place. The petitioners have failed to show that 15.46% is a ‘fair and reasonable’ interest rate.”
With respect to the “fair and reasonable” standard, although it is clear that the Legislature has expressed great disdain for this industry of factoring companies that induce settlement annuitants to cash out future payments at substantial discounts, the law-making body has stopped short of placing a ceiling upon the allowable interest rates. It is incumbent upon the courts to make such a determination, presumably based upon the representations made by the very factoring companies whose interests are to employ the highest discount rate based upon their setting of the prevailing market. Under such circumstances, basing a determination upon the comparable or prevailing interest rates in the industry is dubious.
Some insight and understanding of the factoring industry and the setting of discount rates was provided by a relatively recent article appearing in the Wisconsin Law Review (Scales, Against Settlement Factoring? The Market in Tort Claims Has Arrived, 2002 Wis L Rev 859), in which the author discussed the historical reasons for high discount rates and the downward trend of those rates. The author posited that the customary discount rates of 30% or more enjoyed by factoring companies in the early 1990s, had drastically diminished to just under 17% by 1997, due to increasing competition and the decline of operating costs throughout the industry. The often overlooked fact, as aptly noted by the author (at 930-931), “that factoring companies do not find the money to consummate transactions lying on the ground,” has yielded discount rates that purport to balance profitability with effective capital costs, i.e., the costs associated with borrowing money, as well as legal and servicing expenses. Nevertheless, the enactment of laws, such as the SSPA, the interpretation of such legislation by the judiciary, and increasing competition to the industry, will continue to compel the downward trend of discount rates. The value of this analysis to the court is that the documented research of a disinterested academic establishes that the capital costs of factoring companies have diminished substantially, which should impact positively upon their recovery of costs and the corresponding decrease in discount rates.
Despite the optimism expressed by this court regarding the downward trend of discount rates, the lingering, disquieting aspect of discount rates imposed by factoring companies will persist. This was signaled in In re Transfer of Structured Settlement Rights by Spinelli {supra), a case in which First Providian offered to pay Mr. Spinelli, the payee, a lump sum of $30,000 in exchange for his future rights to $120,000, $50,000 of which was to be received in 2007 and $70,000 in 2013. The court, in granting the petition stated, in pertinent part, the following (353 NJ Super at 470-471, 803 A2d at 178-179):
“A more difficult question is whether the specific terms offered by First Providian are in Spinelli’s best interests . . .
“Whatever the actual profit margin may be for First Providian, the reality for Mr. Spinelli is that he is giving up his right to future money at a sharp discount of 17 to 18% per year. That steep rate of diminution is troubling to the court, especially in today’s economic times when, for instance, residential mortgage loans are at decade-low interest rates in the single digits. Moreover, the risk factors for First Providian (or for its institutional investors) in the transaction would appear to be limited. The structured settlement payments are not contingent on Mr. Spinelli’s life or health. The payments are to be made by the Travelers, a major financial institution that has been in business for decades. Nevertheless, the court is mindful of the uncertainties of our global economy in general, and in particular of the fragility of the insurance market in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks and the current recession. Despite these reservations about First Providian’s quoted rates, the court is persuaded that the transaction should go forward for several reasons.”
The most cogent reason for approval was that Spinelli was an expert in financial transactions and could fully appreciate the impact of the discount rate.
In a recent decision rendered by the Superior Court of Connecticut, entitled Davis v Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. (2002 WL 1818733, *3, 2002 Conn Super LEXIS 2256, *8), the court, in denying approval of a proposed transfer, stated:
“The discount rate of 19.82% is well above prevailing interest rates, including prime, mortgage and credit card interest rates reported daily in the media. It is common knowledge that interest rates are at a 40-year low. Mr. Davis introduced no evidence to establish the reasonableness of the 19.82% discount rate. On the contrary, the divulgence of the 5.6% rate in the disclosure document tends to negate a conclusion that the higher rate is reasonable in the absence of any evidence to the contrary and there is no such contrary evidence before the court. The applicant has not affirmed that he has investigated other alternatives.”
The application before this court suffers the same infirmities acknowledged in the referenced decisions. Clearly, the New York State Legislature in enacting SSPA and in empowering the courts with the discretion to determine whether the terms of a proposed transfer of future payments are fair and reasonable did not intend for the courts to be mere rubber stamps. Here, the amended disclosure statement, included among the documents submitted to establish that the transfer is in Ballos’ best interest and is fair and reasonable, sets forth, inter alia, that the $125,000 out of the $225,000 periodic payment due on October 1, 2010 has a discounted present value of $95,395.15, based upon the applicable 3.6% federal rate most recently published by the Internal Revenue Service. The statement sets forth that $82,409 would be the cost of purchasing a comparable annuity for the aggregate amount of payments to be transferred based upon a quote by Safeco Insurance Company, and that the annual discount rate, compounded monthly, used to determine the gross advance amount is 15.591%. The statement further sets forth that the net advance amount, after deduction of $2,500 in legal fees and the total amount of commissions, fees, costs and expenses and charges payable by Ballos would be $36,500. Petitioner relies upon this amended disclosure statement as evidence that the discount rate is fair and reasonable, a sentiment that is shared by Jean F. Litzler, petitioner’s chief financial officer/senior vice-president, who, in an affidavit in support, stated that “[i]n my opinion, the annual discount rate used to calculate the gross advance amount (15.591%), as shown in the Disclosure Statement provided to Mr. Ballos in this transaction, is fair and reasonable.” While Litzler sets forth the factors that influence the setting of a “typical market discount or interest rate for this type of transaction,” there was no showing as to how these factors specifically resulted in the discount rate applied in this case.
Moreover, the arguments set forth in petitioner’s memorandum of law are not persuasive. In support of its position that the discount rate is fair and reasonable, petitioner refers to the Spinelli decision in In re Transfer of Structured Settlement Rights by Spinelli (supra), and the decision in Settlement Capital Corp. v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (supra), and attaches three cases in which the courts approved transfers with discount rates of 21.50% 21.928% and 21.500%. Notably absent, however, were the two New York State cases for which approval was withheld, including the case in which it was the petitioner, Matter of Settlement Capital Corp. {supra), and in which the court, in denying the petition, stated, with respect to the 18.621% discount rate applied (194 Misc 2d 711, 713 [2003]): “No explanation has been presented as to why this particular discount rate was selected and/or why it should be deemed fair and reasonable. In the absence of such evidence, the court is of the view that it is unable to make the required statutory finding.” {See, also, Matter of Settlement Funding of N.Y., supra at 724 [“Settlement L.L.C. attempts to justify the 15.46% interest rate by declaring that it is entitled to determine the rate at which it will lend money, its interest rate on this transaction falls within the range of what is presently being charged in the ‘market’ for structured settlement transfers, and Cunningham deems the interest rate acceptable. Assuming for the purposes of the argument that all three points are true, none of them is relevant to the question of whether 15.46% is ‘fair and reasonable’ ”].) Here, as in the two prior New York State court decisions, petitioner has failed to establish that the discount rate at issue is fair and reasonable. Moreover, based upon the general downward trend of interest rates, and the indication that such a downward trend is indicated for discount rates in the factoring market {see, 2002 Wis L Rev 859, supra), this court would be hard pressed to find “fair and reasonable” a 15.591% discount rate applied against the $125,000 amount to be transferred here that results in a gross advance amount from SCC of $39,000, and a final net advance amount of $36,500, after deduction for fees incurred by the transaction, including legal fees in the amount of $2,500. This would result in Balios receiving only 29% of the $125,000 amount to be transferred, a consequence that this court finds unconscionable, and will not condone.
Conclusion
Based upon the foregoing, this court finds that the petitioner has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the transaction is in the best interest of Ballos and that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable. Accordingly, the petition is denied.
. The Legislative Memorandum in Support of Laws of 2002 (eh 537) (2002 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 2035, 2036) relating to the enactment of the Structured Settlement Protection Act, set forth the following as justification for the act:
“Structured settlements are a well-recognized means of compensating personal injury victims and workers’ compensation claimants. They are negotiated between the injured person’s counsel and the other parties to a personal injury action or workers’ compensation claim. The structuring of a settlement enables the settlement recipient to receive secure tax-free income over a course of years or a lifetime to provide for future medical care, housing, education, etc. In this way, the proceeds from an award are not dissipated or lost by individuals unaccustomed to managing large sums.
“Recently a growing number of factoring companies have used aggressive advertising, plus the allure of quick and easy cash, to induce settlement recipients to cash out future payments, often at substantial discounts, depriving victims and their families of the long-term financial security their structured settlements were designed to provide. Although transfers of structured settlement payments are generally prohibited by contract (and often prohibited under applicable state law) factoring companies have built a rapidly expanding business around circumventing these prohibitions.
“This market in the buying and selling of injured individuals’ payment streams can pose a hazard to existing recipients of structured settlements and to the public assistance programs on which recipients must often rely, once they have traded away secure income from structured settlements. The market also threatens the viability of structured settlements for injury victims who may need them in the future. This legislation seeks to curtail this practice by limiting transfers of structured settlement payments to true hardship cases. The Act does this by requiring full disclosure of the costs of any factoring transaction, advance notice to interested parties, and court approval of any transfer. Transfers of structured judgments or settlements for workers’ compensation claims would continue to be prohibited.”
. As the contents of the agreement are of a confidential nature, counsel provided the document for in camera review in order to facilitate the resolution of the instant matter.
. See, e.g., NJ Stat Ann § 2A: 16-66 (a) (calling for an express finding “the transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents); Conn Gen Stat Ann § 52-225Í (c) (1) (transfer must be in best interests of payee and fair and reasonable to all interested parties); Fla Stat Ann § 626.99296 (3) (a) (7) (requiring courts to determine that the net amount payable to the transferor of a structured settlement is “fair, just, and reasonable under the circumstances then existing”); Neb Rev Stat § 25-3104 (1) (c) (transfer must be in best interests of payee); Ohio Rev Code Ann § 2323.583 (B) (1) (transfer must be fair and reasonable and in best interests of payee and payee’s dependents); Minn Stat Ann § 549.31 (1) (c) (the payee has established that the transfer is in the best interests of the payee and the payee’s dependents); Cal Ins Code § 10137 (a) (voiding transfers of structured settlement payment rights unless the transfer is “fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee”); 10 Del Code Ann § 6601 (3) (prohibiting structured settlement transfers unless a court finds transfer is “fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the payee and the payee’s dependents”). Similar statutes were in force in Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.
. This court finds disquieting that the payee generally appears pro se together with counsel for the factoring company, who prepares the petition and supporting documentation, and certainly is not a disinterested, impartial advocate for the payee. That the petitioner must demonstrate that the discount rate is fair and reasonable hopefully will balance a scale that appears to favor the factoring company.
. Adam F. Scales, in the Wisconsin Law Review article entitled Against Settlement Factoring? The Market in Tort Claims Has Arrived, stated, in pertinent part (id. at 931): “Increasingly, factoring companies deal only with court-approved 'paper’ because their credit sources require it as a condition of underwriting their activities. The new laws obviously provide a ready route for doing so. Together with increased competition — already here in the form of the insurance industry, and likely to accelerate — factoring’s capital and service costs should decline to slightly above the current rates for lottery payment sales, which average about two points over comparable Treasurys. One large insurer reported to me that it expects to offer commutation at a discount rate of approximately 5%. Particularly in those states that specifically condition approval upon compliance with ‘fair market value’ or specified discount rates, the number of cases involving rapacious terms should be few.”
. The factors outlined were “(i) the total term of the payment stream; (ii) the level of cooperation of the insurance company that issued or owns the annuity in obtaining the required court approval; (iii) legal fees incurred; (iv) inflation and other economic trends; (v) the financial stability of the insurance company obligated to make the payments; (vi) risks of default; (vii) uncertainty of the legal arena; (viii) and profit expectations.”",0
0873-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Salvatore J. Modica, J.
The defendant is charged with a single count of sexual misconduct under Penal Law § 130.20 (1). It is alleged that this 19-year-old defendant had sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl “numerous times” between the dates of September 22, 2002 and April 2, 2003. The defendant, relying on People v Keindl (68 NY2d 410 [1986]), contends that the accusatory instrument should be dismissed as a denial of due process and as duplicitous. (See also CPL 170.30 [1] [f].) The court agrees that the accusatory instrument is defective. Nevertheless, dismissal is inappropriate at this time. The People, in accordance with this opinion, will be given an opportunity to cure the defect by either filing a superseding information or prosecutor’s information, or serving a bill of particulars.
Under both the State and Federal Constitutions, a defendant is entitled to “fair notice of the nature of the charges against him, and of the manner, time and place of the conduct underlying the accusations, so as to enable him to answer the charges and prepare an adequate defense.” (People v Keindl, supra, 68 NY2d at 416; see also US Const 6th, 14th Amends; NY Const, art I, § 6; Cole v Arkansas, 333 US 196 [1948]; Herring v New York, 422 US 853, 857 [1975].) The additional importance of providing the defense with specific details of the charges is that it enables a defendant to raise, upon conviction, “the constitutional bar of double jeopardy against subsequent prosecutions for the same offense.” (People v Keindl, supra, 68 NY2d at 416; People v Morris, 61 NY2d 290 [1984].) Some of these constitutional protections are reflected in CPL 200.50 (3) and (7), which require individual counts in an indictment to be drafted with sufficient precision, and CPL 200.30 (1), which prohibits duplicitous pleading. (People v Morris, supra, 61 NY2d 290 [1984]; People v Keindl, supra, 68 NY2d at 417-418.)
With respect to whether an accusatory instrument has been drafted with sufficient clarity, if time is not an element of a crime, the Criminal Procedure Law neither mandates that a single date be pleaded in an indictment nor does it impose a restriction on the length of the designated time period. (See CPL 200.50 [6]; People v Morris, supra, 61 NY2d at 294.) Thus, CPL 200.50 (6) allows a crime to be pleaded in the disjunctive, meaning “on or about, a designated date, or during a designated period of time.” Put another way, the accusatory instrument may, “as supplemented by the bill of particulars . . . allege the time in approximate terms.” (People v Watt, 81 NY2d 772, 774 [1993].) Nevertheless, despite the permissive language of CPL 200.50 (6), it still remains to be determined whether the designated period of time in the accusatory instrument adequately informs the defendant of the accusation within the meaning of the New York State and Federal Constitutions. (People v Morris, supra, 61 NY2d at 290.) A charge in an accusatory instrument violates the constitutional guarantees of fair notice when the time interval during which the crime is alleged to have taken place is so unreasonably excessive that a defendant cannot possibly defend against the charges and prepare a defense.
Under CPL 200.30 (1), a charge is duplicitous when more than one offense is alleged in a single count of an indictment. In the words of the Court of Appeals, “each count of an [accusatory instrument may] charge only one offense” and that “where one count alleges the commission of a particular offense repeatedly during a designated period of time, that count encompasses more than one offense and is duplicitous.” (People v Beauchamp, 74 NY2d 639, 640 [1989], quoting People v Keindl, supra, 68 NY2d at 417-418.) The rule against duplicitous pleadings furthers not only the constitutional guarantee that the defendant be able to prepare a defense and the constitutional protection against being placed in double jeopardy, but it also ensures the reliability of the unanimous verdict. “If two or more offenses are alleged in one count, individual jurors might vote to convict a defendant of that count on the basis of different offenses; the defendant would thus stand convicted under that count even though the jury may never have reached a unanimous verdict as to any one of the offenses.” (People v Keindl, supra, 68 NY2d at 418.)
It should be noted, however, that the prohibitions against excessive time spans and duplicity generally apply only to offenses that are punishable by the performance of a single act, such as sodomy, rape, and sexual abuse. With respect to these offenses, multiple acts between the same individuals over a prolonged time period may not be alleged in a single count. (See People v Keindl, supra, 68 NY2d at 417-418.) By contrast, some offenses may, by definition, be committed by multiple acts. These offenses, which are characterized as continuing offenses, may allege time spans that might otherwise be considered unreasonably excessive. For instance, endangering the welfare of a minor may be committed by one act or multiple acts. It is, therefore, proper to charge this crime based upon a pattern of sexual behavior toward a child over an extended period of time. (People v Keindl, supra at 417-418.) In this case, the defendant is charged with sexual misconduct under Penal Law § 130.20 (1). This crime prohibits a defendant from engaging in sexual intercjourse with a person of the opposite gender without such person’s consent. Given that each act of sexual intercourse is a separate offense, it cannot be designated a continuing crime. (See e.g. People v Keindl, supra at 420.) ¡
With these principles in mind, the court first addresses the defendant’s contention that the time interval duringj which the defendant is alleged to have committed the crime of sexual misconduct is so excessive that he can neither defend against this charge nor prepare a defense. In Keindl, the defendant was convicted of numerous counts of sodomy and sexual ¡abuse and several counts of endangering the welfare of a child. These charges related to multiple sexual acts allegedly committed against three children, aged 8, 10, and 13 years old, over a period of from 10 to 16 months. Reversing the defendant’s convictions for sodomy and sexual abuse, the Court held that the time interval was so excessive on its face that it deprived jthe defendant of the right to be informed of the accusations and prepare a defense, and it exposed him to subsequent prosecutions for the same offenses. The Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion in Beauchamp, concluding that “the time period during which the crimes were alleged to have occurrejl (Oct. 31, 1983 — Aug. 1, 1984, excluding weekends) was so excessive that it was unreasonable.” (People v Beauchamp, supra, 74 NY2d at 641.) Thus, in both Keindl and Beauchamp, the time periods were deemed excessive per se and dismissals were required.
On the other hand, in People v Watt (81 NY2d 772 [1993]), an allegation of a five-month period within which the defendant allegedly engaged in sexual acts with children was not a per se unreasonable time period in which to charge. And in People u Morris (supra), a time interval of three weeks was also held not to be unreasonably excessive per se. It must be j stressed, however, that a court’s conclusion that a disputed time interval is not per se unreasonably excessive does not end the inquiry. As noted by the Court of Appeals, even though an accusatory instrument “may allege the time in approximate terms,” the time interval must still operate to give a defendant fair notice of the charges. (People v Watt, supra, 81 NY2d at 774¡) Accordingly, even in cases where the per se bar does not apply, an accusatory instrument, as supplemented by a bill of particulars, must still be scrutinized to determine whether the time interval passes constitutional muster. (Id.) That determination must be made in each case taking into account all relevant circumstances. (People v Morris, supra, 61 NY2d at 290, 295.) As stated in Watt,
“The noninclusive list of factors includes the length of the time span provided by the People and the knowledge the People possess or should acquire with reasonable diligence of the exact or approximate date or dates of the criminal conduct. Additionally, relevant factors include the age and intelligence of the victim and other witnesses; the nature of the offense or offenses, including whether they are likely to be discovered immediately and whether there is a criminal pattern; and all other surrounding circumstances.” (People v Watt, supra, 81 NY2d at 774-775.)
In this case, the time interval is 6 months and 11 days. That time period is significantly longer than the time period in Morris and exceeds the time period in Watt by almost IV2 months. In the view of this court, the time span is per se unreasonable. Nevertheless, dismissal is stayed pending the filing by the District Attorney, within 21 days of the date of this order, either a prosecutor’s information, a superseding information, or a bill of particulars, alleging a shorter time period for the charge in this case. (See CPL 170.35 [1] [a].) The People must keep in mind that if they intend to prove that the alleged crime was committed within a certain time span rather than on a specific date, then they should consider the factors as outlined in this opinion. If the defendant is of the opinion that the paperwork filed by the District Attorney has not adequately cured the defect and that the charge lacks sufficient clarity, then he has leave to renew the motion to dismiss the charge.
The court further concludes that the crime of sexual misconduct as alleged in this accusatory instrument is duplicitous and must be dismissed. Given that the crime of sexual misconduct under Penal Law § 130.20 (1) punishes the performance of a single act, it is not a continuing crime. For this reason, the prohibition against duplicitous pleadings is applicable. In this case, the defendant is alleged to have had sexual intercourse repeatedly with a 14-year-old girl for a period of almost seven months. As drafted, the accusatory instrument alleges the commission of multiple violations of sexual misconduct under Penal Law § 130.20 (1) and is, therefore, defective. Nevertheless, dismissal is stayed pending the filing of either a superseding information, a prosecutor’s information, or a bill of particulars by the District Attorney, curing this defect, within 21 days of the date of this order. As noted in People v Davis (72 NY2d 32, 38 [1988]), when “the number of offenses charged by a particular count [of an indictment] is uncertain because the precise time oi the commission of the crime is not clearly stated . . . [t]he defect may be cured by reference to a bill of particulars.”
Finally, the court acknowledges that the accusatdry instrument in this case is an information and, as such, is governed by articles 100 and 170 of the Criminal Procedure Law, both of which lack the provisions contained in CPL 200.30 and 200.50. The court further acknowledges that CPL 200.30 and 200.50 are not expressly applicable to informations. That the Legislature failed to extend the requirements contained in CPL 200.30 and 200.50 to informations, however, is not dispositive. The provisions of CPL 200.30 and 200.50 serve a due process role in that they provide the defendant with sufficient information as to the nature of the charge and the underlying conduct so that he/she may prepare a defense. (See e.g. People v Shack, 86 NY2d 529 [1995].) Not only do these provisions further the defendant’s right to due process under both the Federal and New York State Constitutions, but they also serve to protect the defendant from being placed in jeopardy for the same offense. (People v Morris, supra, 61 NY2d at 293.) In addition, these provisions ensure the unanimity of the verdict, which is required under | both the United States Constitution and the Criminal Procedure Law. It is clear, therefore, that the provisions of CPL 200.30 and 200.50, which prohibit duplicitous pleadings and which require sufficient precision in the drafting of charges, are constitutionally required in all criminal cases. (See e.g. People v Saldana, 172 Misc 2d 79 [Crim Ct, Bronx County 1997]; see People v Mitchell, 151 Misc 2d 208 [Crim Ct, Kings County 1991]; see also People v Todd, 119 Misc 2d 488 [Crim Ct, NY County 1983].) As discussed above, those constitutional rights and protections have been violated in this case.
Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss the information is granted. The court’s order, however, is stayed for 21 days in accordance with this opinion.
. The Criminal Procedure Law, however, requires that a prosecutor’s information “be in the form prescribed for an indictment, pursuant to section 200.50, and must, in one or more counts, allege the offense or offenses charged and a plain and concise statement of the conduct constituting each such offense.” (CPL 100.35.) No similar provision exists for informations.!
. The New York State Constitution does not provide the right to a trial by jury when a defendant is prosecuted by a local criminal court accusatory instrument. (See People v Erickson, 302 NY 461 [1951].) The Sta1)e Constitution grants a defendant such right only where he has been indicted! by a grand jury for any offense or where the defendant is being prosecuted by a superior court information. (See NY Const, art I, § 2; see also NY Const, art VI, § 18.) The State Constitution notwithstanding, the United States Supreme Court, in Baldwin v New York (399 US 66 [1970]), held that the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to a jury trial for any “serious” offense, for which an authorized sentence in excess of six months can be imposed. The federal constitutional requirement is met where the jury is composed of at least six persons. (See Williams v Florida, 399 US 78 [1970]; Apodaca v Oregon, 406 US 404 [1972] [the Federal Constitution does not require that a jury be comprised of 12 persons]; see also Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 340.40, at 119-120.) If the number is set at six persons, however, then the jury’s verdict requires unanimity. (See Burch v Louisiana, 441 US 130 [1979].) Following the decision in Baldwin, the New York State Legislature, in 1971, expanded the statutory right to a jury trial for misdemeanors prosecuted by information in the New York City Criminal Court for which the authorized sentence is in excess of six months. (See CPL 340.40.) Pursuant to CPL 360.10 (1), a jury trial of an information in a local criminal court consists of six jurors. If not expressly stated, implicit in the New York statutory scheme is the requirement that the jury’s verdict must be unanimous. (See CPL 360.55, 310.50, 310.80.)",0

Joseph C. Teresi, J.
Petitioner makes this motion to require respondent to produce a copy of the “root cause analysis” and any other internal review conducted and prepared with respect to the death of Kenneth Butler. Respondent opposes the motion. I
On October 27, 2002, Butler was arrested and incarcerated at the Rockland County Jail. He died in Nyack Hospital on November 10, 2002. At the time of his death, Butler was an inmate committed to the custody of the Rockland County Jail. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires respondent to conduct a review of the cause and background of the events surrounding the death of jan inmate who dies while in its custody. In the present case, respondent completed such a review which is commonly referred to as a “root cause analysis” and petitioner seeks to obtain a copy of the “root cause analysis” that was completed regarding the circumstances of Butler’s death.
Petitioner Alan J. Croce serves as Chairman and Commissioner of the New York State Commission of Correction. The Commission of Correction via its Medical Revievf Board is statutorily required pursuant to Correction Law § 47 (1) (a) to “[^Investigate and review the cause and circumstances surrounding the death of any inmate of a correctional facility.” As a result of Mr. Butler’s death, the Commission initiated such an • . investigation.
The respondent, Anjan Bhattacharyya, is employed as Rock-land County Commissioner of Hospitals and was so employed on November 10, 2002. Respondent’s duties include the oversight of the Rockland County Correctional Health Services, the county agency that provides health services to inmates of the Rockland County Jail. After Mr. Butler’s death, a “root cause analysis” or some type of internal review was conducted and documented regarding the health services provided Mr. Butler at the Rockland County Jail prior to his death and is currently in the possession of the respondent.
Respondent argues that petitioner’s request should ¡be denied because the material requested by petitioner is privileged and confidential, and petitioner’s authority to obtain such documents is at cross-purposes with respondent’s legal obligation to provide adequate medical care to inmates. Respondent believes that if forced to provide petitioner with a copy of the “root cause analysis” relating to Mr. Butler’s death, it will adversely affect respondent (and by extension the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Hospitals) from conducting future “root cause analyses” and internal reviews effectively because of a fear of blame or reprisal. As a result, this will have a significant negative impact on respondent’s ability to improve performance and prevent future deaths of inmates from occurring.
Respondent also argues that Public Health Law § 2805-m (1) provides that information required to be collected pursuant to section 2805-j “shall be kept confidential and shall not be released except to the department [of health].” Respondent argues that “root cause analyses” are comprised of information collected pursuant to section 2805-j. Therefore, “root cause analyses” should not be released to any entity other than the Department of Health. Respondent also argues that Education Law § 6527 (3) excludes disclosure of the “root cause analysis” to petitioner.
In the present case, neither party provided this court with case law that was directly on point. This case places the petitioner’s statutory obligation under Correction Law § 47 in direct conflict with the respondent’s duty to provide adequate health care to inmates. Respondent argues that if it turns over the “root cause analysis” and other internal review material, its ability to meet the needs of inmates in the future would be impaired. This court disagrees and finds that in balancing the equities the greater harm will result from denial of petitioner’s request.
After a full review of the record, this court will grant petitioner’s motion and require respondent to produce a copy of the “root cause analysis” and any other internal review conducted and prepared with respect to the death of Kenneth Butler. Petitioner has a statutory right to examine any and all materials, including the “root cause analysis” under Correction Law § 47 (1) (a), which empowers petitioner to “[investigate and review the cause and circumstances surrounding the death of any inmate of a correctional facility.” Additionally, Correction Law § 44 (4) provides that “[t]he chairman may request and receive from any department, division, board, bureau, commission or other agency of the state or any political subdivision thereof or any public authority such assistance, information and data as will enable the commission, the board and the council properly to carry out its functions, powers and duties.” Therefore, petitioner is statutorily entitled to review the “root cause analysis” and other internal review materialj in respondent’s possession.
This court considered respondent’s arguments that Public Health Law § 2801 (1), § 2805-j (1) (a), and § 2805-m precluded respondent from turning over the “root cause analysis” to petitioner, but ultimately rejects them, because petitioner has the statutory authority under Correction Law to investigate the death of any inmate of a correctional facility. Additionally, this court considered and also rejected respondent’s argument that Education Law § 6527 (3) prevented the disclosure of the “root cause analysis” to petitioner. This court finds that petitioner’s statutory duty compels respondent to turn over any and all information relating to Mr. Butler’s death.
Finally, Correction Law § 46 (1) sets forth that “|[t]he commission, any member or any employee designated by the commission must be granted access at any and all times to any correctional facility or part thereof and to all books, records, and data pertaining to any correctional facility deemed necessary for carrying out the commission’s functions, powers ajnd duties. The commission, any member or any employee designated by the chairman may require from the officers or employees of a correctional facility any information deemed necessary for the purpose of carrying out the commission’s functions, flowers and duties.” Petitioner has the statutory authority to investigate the death of any inmate in custody and collect any materials that help further its investigation. This court holds that petitioner is legally entitled to the “root cause analysis” currently in respondent’s possession, and respondent must provide petitioner with the complete “root cause analysis” relating to the death of Mr. Butler within 10 days of this decision. The court has considered the respondent’s remaining arguments and finds them to be without merit. I",0
0764-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Peter P. Rosato, J.
By way of order to show cause dated June 24, 2003 and made returnable on July 15, 2003, petitioner herein seeks an order declaring RPTL 727 inapplicable to the proceedings herein. Alternatively, pursuant to RPTL 710, petitioner seeks an order consolidating the proceedings herein with certain other proceedings presently pending before this court, namely, the proceedings in Ford Leasing Dev. Co. v Assessor of Town of Greenburgh et al. (Index Nos. 15240/96, 15779/97, 14271/98, 14838/99, 15325/00). Petitioner also seeks an order setting an immediate trial date for the above-captioned Niksus proceedings.
The subject of the instant proceeding is an automobile dealership, i.e., Scarsdale Ford, Inc. located at 887 Central Park Avenue in Scarsdale, New York. Prior to sale of the subject property in December 2000, Ford Leasing Development Co. leased said property to Scarsdale Ford, Inc., whose president and sole shareholder was Mr. Marvin Suskin. However, in and about December 2000, Ford sold the subject property to Niksus Realty for $1,833,000. Mr. Suskin is acknowledged to be the owner of Niksus.
Following numerous conferences, under court supervision, a settlement was reached in May 2003 between counsel for Ford, the Town of Greenburgh and intervenor-respondent Edgemont Union Free School District for the 1996-2000 proceedings. While petitioner Niksus herein, the new owner of the property, was, per the instant order to show cause dated June 24, 2003, formally denied a temporary stay precluding the court from signing off on the proposed settlement pending determination of the instant application, the court, as a practical matter, has refrained from signing any such proposed order or judgment pending decision herein.
In seeking to prohibit respondents from enforcing RPTL 727 herein, petitioner relies on what it characterizes as the “strikingly similar” decision rendered in Susquehanna Dev. v Assessor of City of Binghamton (185 Misc 2d 267 [Sup Ct, Tompkins County 2000, Relihan, J.]) wherein the court, on the particular facts of that case, did in fact hold that RPTL 727 was unconstitutional as applied to a new owner. However, upon closer scrutiny it is readily apparent that very significant differences exist vis-á-vis the facts of the instant case and the facts presented in Susquehanna (supra). In the Susquehanna case, the court was careful to point out “an unlikely combination of factors” would be required in order for a subsequent owner to defeat the three-year moratorium period. (See Susquehanna Dev. v Assessor, supra at 273.) More specifically, the Susquehanna court held that two factors in particular would be required to defeat section 727, namely, (1) an assessment which exceeds constitutional limits, and (2) a transferee who had absolutely no connection whatsoever to the assessment reduction at issue. Both of those factors existed in Susquehanna. In fact, in Susquehanna (supra), the current assessment ($1,600,000) was actually quadruple the $400,000 purchase price petitioner had paid to acquire the subject property literally 24 hours prior to the City again reassessing the property at the $1,600,000 level. Such assessment glaringly violated the mandate contained at article XVI, § 2 of the NY Constitution that “ ‘[assessments shall in no case exceed full value,’ ” a recent arm’s length sale being considered the best evidence of value. (See Susquehanna, supra at 269.)
Here in the instant case, on the other hand, the arguments raised by petitioner, the subsequent owner-transferee, are markedly different. Here, petitioner’s argument rests entirely on annual fluctuations in the equalization rate. More specifically, petitioner represents that the equalization rate for the Town of Greenburgh in the year 2000 was 6.20% whereas in 2002 the equalization rate was 4.52%, a decline of 27% from the year 2000 rate. Thus, petitioner argues that the assessment agreed upon by the previous owner for calendar year 2000 “would equate to a market value 27% higher for 2002.” (See petitioner’s supporting affirmation, dated June 24, 2003, at 3.) Petitioner then goes on to argue, in rather bald and conclusory fashion, that RPTL 727, if applied herein, “would cause the subject property’s assessment to be in excess of its full market value.” (See petitioner’s supporting affirmation at 4.)
The instant case, while not strikingly similar to Susquehanna (supra), is in fact strikingly similar to the recent unreported March 20, 2003 decision, order and judgment of this court in Rib Knitting v Town of Ramapo (Sup Ct, Rockland County, Index No. 1542/02). In Rib Knitting, the plaintiff sought a declaration declaring that RPTL 727 is unconstitutional as applied to the subject property. The plaintiff in Rib Knitting (supra), much like the petitioner herein, was a subsequent owner of the subject property who took no part in the settlement reached by the prior owner relative to earlier tax years. As in the instant case, the plaintiff in Rib Knitting (supra) argued that the facts of Rib Knitting were much like the facts of Susquehanna (supra), and sought therefore to have the court adopt Susquehanna as precedent. However, this court in Rib Knitting ultimately declined to follow Susquehanna for the simple reason that, on closer scrutiny, the facts of Rib Knitting were actually markedly different from the facts of Susquehanna. The fact pattern in Rib Knitting (supra) did not generate the “unlikely combination of factors” found in Susquehanna (supra at 273). Rib Knitting did not involve an assessment in excess of constitutional limits, as occurred in Susquehanna. Rather, the crux of plaintiffs argument in Rib Knitting, like the crux of petitioner’s argument herein, is predicated on annual fluctuations in the equalization rate for the subject municipality. That is to say, petitioner herein argues that if he is “locked in” by RPTL 727 for calendar years 2001 and 2002 at the figure agreed to by the prior owner for year 2000, he will be unable to resolve these more recent proceedings at the appropriate equalization rates for these years. Such an argument, as this court previously found in Rib Knitting (supra), simply does not serve to duplicate the “unlikely combination of factors” which arose in Susquehanna. As noted above, here in Niksus, and unlike Susquehanna, there is, pivotally, no assessment in excess of constitutional limits, as evinced by the recent sale price of the subject property, i.e., $1,833,000 in December 2000. (And see corrected, i.e., reduced assessments for calendar years 1996-2000, all far lower than the December 2000 purchase price, as contained at proposed stipulation of settlement, exhibit B to opposing affirmation of Ford Leasing Development Co.) Moreover, in view of petitioner’s acknowledgment that Mr. Marvin Suskin, now the owner of petitioner Niksus, was also the president and sole shareholder of Scarsdale Ford, Inc., the former lessee of the subject property, it is at least arguable that Niksus may also fail to meet the second criteria identified in Susquehanna, i.e., a wholly unconnected transferee.
Accordingly, for all the above-stated reasons, the court finds Susquehanna (supra) to be distinguishable and therefore denies petitioner’s instant application to declare RPTL 727 inapplicable to the instant proceedings.
Further, to the extent petitioner, in the alternative, seeks to consolidate the instant proceedings with the aforementioned Ford Leasing proceedings pursuant to RPTL 710, the court, in view of the instant decision herein, will now proceed to sign off on a proposed order and/or stipulation of settlement arising from the settlement of the Ford Leasing proceedings. That being the case, there will literally be nothing, i.e., no pending petitions, to consolidate the instant proceedings with. Therefore, petitioner’s alternative application for consolidation under RPTL 710, combined with a further request that the court set an immediate trial date, is hereby denied as well in all respects.
. Marvin Suskin is also described by petitioner as the “net lessee” under the Ford lease, responsible for payment of all real estate taxes for the years 1996-2000.
. Counsel for Ford Leasing Development Co., petitioner in the related proceedings herein for years 1996-2000, has submitted an opposing affirmation dated July 11, 2003 wherein they oppose so much of Niksus’ application as seeks consolidation. Ford Leasing does not oppose that branch of the instant application seeking to declare RPTL 727 inapplicable to the instant proceedings.
. As noted at the outset, petitioner herein likewise seeks a declaration from the court, namely, a declaration that RPTL 727 is simply inapplicable to the instant proceedings. As this court pointed out in Rib Knitting (supra), the appropriate procedural vehicle by which to seek such relief would be a declaratory judgment action brought on pursuant to CPLR 3001. Accordingly, to the extent petitioner seeks a declaration that RPTL 727 is inapplicable herein, the court will deem such claim to have been brought on pursuant to CPLR 3001.
. RPTL 727, it should be noted, does not list fluctuation in equalization rates as one of its stated exceptions.",0

Francois A. Rivera, J.
Petitioner moves for an order pursuant to CPLR 7503 (b) permanently staying all uninsured motorist arbitration proceedings between petitioner National Grange Mutual Insurance Company and respondents. In the alternative, petitioner moves for an order temporarily staying the uninsured arbitration proceedings, adding proposed additional respondents and directing a framed issue hearing. Petitioner also moves for an order directing all discovery required under the terms of petitioner’s insurance policy. Respondents oppose only so much of the petition that seeks a permanent stay of arbitration and otherwise consent to discovery, and a temporary stay of arbitration pending a framed issue hearing.
Respondents, Yelena Vitebskaya and Mikhail Furman, are plaintiffs in a separate related action against Anatoliy Berezan and Ah Aliyev pending in this court under index number 46529/ 01. In that action, they seek damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered in a motor vehicle collision. By decision issued August 13, 2002, another justice of this court granted respondents’ request for a judgment of default on the issue of liability against Anatoliy Berezan and Ali Aliyev.
The motor vehicle incident underlying this petition and respondents’ related action occurred on January 29, 1999, where Anatoliy Berezan was driving the respondents in his 1987 Subaru on the eastbound lanes of the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn. Sometime between 11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., he struck the rear of a 1993 Lincoln sedan with livery plates. Ali Aliyev was the owner and operator of the Lincoln sedan. At that time, National Grange Mutual Insurance Company was the insurer of Anatoliy Berezan’s vehicle. Star Insurance Company purportedly insured Ali Aliyev’s Lincoln sedan.
Petitioner, National Grange Insurance Company, disclaimed coverage of the Berezan vehicle claiming that the collision was an intentional act and thus not covered by the accident protection benefit of the insurance policy. Yelena Vitebskaya and Mikhail Furman filed a demand for uninsured motorist arbitration upon petitioner National Grange Mutual Insurance Company. Petitioner received the demand for arbitration and has filed the instant petition to permanently stay arbitration.
Petitioner alleges that Anatoliy Berezan is fraudulently seeking accident insurance coverage for an intentional collision. In support of its contention, petitioner has presented copies of police reports, deposition testimony of respondents Yelena Vitebskaya and Mikhail Furman, as well as recorded and written statements of Anatoliy Berezan. The submitted documents reveal several salient and undisputed facts. Among these facts, petitioner shows that the Berezan vehicle’s insurance policy application was submitted on December 1, 1998. On December 3, 1998, a mere two days later, Anatoliy Berezan drove his 1987 Subaru onto the Belt Parkway and struck the rear of a 1993 Lincoln sedan with livery plates. This collision occurred as well between 11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. On January 29, 1999, less than 60 days after the first collision, Anatoliy Berezan’s vehicle was involved in a nearly identical collision that gave rise to the instant dispute. On February 19, 1999, just 2V2 months after the inception of the policy, it was cancelled for nonpayment of the premium.
Petitioner also points out numerous inconsistencies between the written and recorded statements Anatoliy Berezan provided them pertaining to the January 29, 1999 collision. The two statements contain discrepancies about the identities of his passengers and how he knew them. In his recorded statement taken on March 8, 1999, he stated that there were three passengers in his vehicle, one female and two males. The police report, on the contrary, only listed two passengers in his vehicle. Interestingly, he also stated that he did not know the names of the passengers, that they were friends of his mother, and that he was driving them home after they had visited her. After the collision, he said he gave the vehicle to a cousin.
In a written statement made on April 22, 1999, Mr. Berezan indicated that his three passengers were friends of a friend named Slava and that he was giving them a ride home to Ganar sie. Mr. Berezan stated in his written statement that he “junked” the Subaru after the collision.
There were also discrepancies between Mr. Berezan’s statements and the deposition testimony of the respondents. These discrepancies pertain to the time and sequence in which each occupant entered the vehicle, their reasons for entering the vehicle, their intended destination and what transpired after the collision. Mikhail Furman, in his deposition conducted on August 4, 1999, testified that their destination was the home of Yelena Vitebskaya’s brother, Naum. He further testified that he knew Naum from Kiev but did not know his last name. He said that Naum lived off the Belt Parkway near Kennedy Airport. He also testified that he and Yelena entered Mr. Berezan’s vehicle at separate times.
In contrast, respondent Yelena Vitebskaya testified at her deposition that Naum was her friend and that he lived near Kings Plaza. Ms. Vitebskaya testified that she knew Mr. Berezan and that they both knew Naum. She further testified that Berezan picked up both her and Mr. Furman together from the front of her apartment building.
Petitioner also notes that National Grange Mutual Insurance Company was granted summary judgment against Millennium Medical Diagnostics, PC., a health care provider of respondents, who commenced an action to recover no-fault benefits. Petitioner was awarded summary judgment after alleging that Millennium Medical Diagnostics was not operating legally. Millennium Medical Diagnostics failed to contest petitioner’s allegation.
A party who has grounds to oppose arbitration may preserve the right to litigate the underlying dispute in court by timely applying for a stay of arbitration pursuant to CPLR 7503 (b). On such application, the “threshold” defenses to arbitration can be raised. A court will not stay arbitration, however, unless the entire controversy is nonarbitrable. If there is at least one arbitrable issue, arbitration should proceed (Matter of Silverman [Benmor Coats], 61 NY2d 299, 302, 309 [1984]).
It is well settled that a party seeking insurance benefits must prove that a loss occurred and that the loss was covered by the insurance policy (Vasile v Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co., 213 AD2d 541 [2d Dept 1995]). When loss is the result of an intentional act, there is no coverage (Matter of Metro Med. Diagnostics v Eagle Ins. Co., 293 AD2d 751 [2d Dept 2002]). The two collisions Berezan was involved in have remarkable similarities including the time and place of the occurrences and the types of vehicles involved. This and the other discrepancies presented by the petitioner form a compelling and persuasive body of circumstantial evidence that the underlying loss resulted from an intentional collision staged for the purpose of insurance fraud. This showing is sufficient to shift the burden to the respondents to dispute the allegation of fraud.
Respondents, on the other hand, have failed to proffer any facts which dispute petitioner’s allegation that the collision was intentional (State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Laguerre, 305 AD2d 490 [2d Dept 2003]). Since the respondents have not met their burden to dispute the allegation of fraud, a framed issue hearing is unnecessary. Petitioner cannot be compelled to arbitrate a claim that the parties never agreed to arbitrate and for which there is no coverage (Matter of Worcester Ins. Co. v Bettenhauser, 95 NY2d 185 [2000]).
Moreover, an intentional act may void coverage even if not committed by the claimant (Matter of Progressive Northwestern Ins. Co. v Van Dina, 282 AD2d 680 [2d Dept 2001]). Thus, even though respondents may be innocent victims, petitioner is not required to provide benefits when a collision is a result of an intentional act (see State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Laguerre, 305 AD2d 490 [2d Dept 2003]). Since respondents’ injuries were not the result of an accident, they are not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under the subject insurance policy (see Progressive Northwestern Ins. Co. v Van Dina, supra, 282 AD2d at 680; Matter of Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v Perry, 220 AD2d 497 [2d Dept 1995]).
Petitioner’s request for a permanent stay of arbitration is granted in its entirety. Although respondents consented to all other relief requested by the petitioner, those matters are rendered moot by this decision and order.",0
0412-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Andrew V. Siracuse, J.
The plaintiff here is suing for application and lock-in fees in a mortgage application that was never consummated. The defendant, in turn, argues that the plaintiff failed to make a federally-mandated disclosure at a time when she could cancel the transaction without penalty. This would appear to be a simple question, and the dispute involves a negligible amount of money — a mere $1,200. Nonetheless, it raises an important point that, to the court’s knowledge, has never been resolved by any court in the United States. It requires the court to look at a number of federal and state statutes and regulations that rarely refer to one another and whose combination into a coherent scheme is left to the judiciary. In the end, the court’s decision must be based on the evident intent of the legislatures involved, an intent that would be frustrated unless the defendant’s position is adopted.
The defendant, who lives in a suburb in the Albany area, was seeking to refinance the house she lived in with her husband. (Although it seems that he was intended to be a party to the mortgage as well, he did not participate in the negotiations and initial document exchanges and thus is not involved in this lawsuit.) She dealt with the plaintiff firm, some 200 miles away, by telephone and fax. The record contains documents signed by the defendant showing receipt of a preapplication disclosure of a $100 application fee and a few other fees, for appraisals and similar charges. She also signed and faxed back a lock-in agreement in full compliance with 3 NYCRR 38.6. This document secures an offer of a fixed rate mortgage at 5.75% with no points, good for one month, in consideration of a payment of $1,100 (one percent of the loan principal). As the regulations require, this payment would be refunded at the closing of the loan, or if the loan were rejected because of the results of an appraisal, the failure of a third-party lender to cooperate, or the credit worthiness of the applicant. The defendant also signed a credit card authorization for these fees.
After these documents were exchanged the plaintiff took the information needed for a full mortgage application over the telephone. The application was then faxed to the defendant for her signature. At about this time (there is some dispute about the timing of these exchanges) plaintiff also sent defendant a disclosure, in the form required by 12 USC § 2605 (a), of the number of mortgages routinely assigned or sold on the secondary mortgage by plaintiff.
This was the deal breaker. The document revealed that plaintiff disposed of most of its mortgages — anywhere from 76 to 100%. The defendant, who has maintained that she repeatedly told plaintiff’s employees she did not want her mortgage assigned, refused to sign the application once she learned this. She also refused to pay the fees, and this proceeding followed.
The parties have differing views on the timing of the disclosure and its relation to the delivery of the application to the defendant. These arguments may be put to one side. The issue, it seems to the court, is whether the disclosure was made before the transaction was consummated. Because the lock-in agreement secures all relevant terms of the mortgage, the court holds that the disclosure made after defendant signed the lock-in agreement was untimely.
There is nothing in the New York regulations concerning lock-in agreements that sets out what disclosures are required and when they must be made; nor does 3 NYCRR 38.1 et seq. provide any guidance on questions regarding the interplay between such agreements and the mortgage application. It is necessary, then, to consult the two federal statutes that control such loans: the Truth in Lending Act (15 USC § 1601 et seq.) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 USC § 2601), and the regulations under both these statutes.
It is only the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) which requires disclosure of the number of mortgage loans assigned or sold. To add to the confusion, most other disclosure requirements are found in the Truth in Lending Act. RESPA regulations require that the disclosure be made “[a]t the time an application for a mortgage servicing loan is submitted, or within 3 business days after submission of the application” (24 CFR 3500.21 [b] [1]). They further specify that disclosure must be made at the time of the application when there is a face-to-face interview (24 CFR 3500.21 [c] [1]) and is to be mailed within three days if no such interview takes place (24 CFR 3500.21 [c] [2]).
The parties have also debated whether a telephone application is one made face-to-face. The court finds no merit in any claim that a transaction conducted between two parties in different buildings in different cities is somehow face-to-face because it happens in real time. Surely the letter of these regulations would be met under these circumstances by mailing the disclosure.
But this does not end the discussion. RESPA does not address lock-in agreements, and in the matter of disclosures is basically an appendix to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The court has to ask what purpose is to be served by this disclosure, and which party’s arguments in the present case best effectuate that purpose.
Fortunately, the announced purpose of TILA is consistent with the timing requirement in that statute. In keeping with the trend toward supplying consumers with more information than market forces alone would provide, TILA is meant to permit a more judicious use of credit by consumers through a “meaningful disclosure of credit terms” (15 USC § 1601 [a]). For that reason the disclosures must be made conspicuously and in writing, and they must be made “before consummation of the transaction” (12 CFR 226.17 [b]).
These two provisions clearly support one another. The purpose of a disclosure is frustrated if one could not act on the information without incurring a penalty. The information required by TILA must be given at a time when the consumer can back out of the transaction. In any other case they would be useless.
This regulation — disclosure before consummation — was promulgated under TILA. What relevance does it have to RESPA? At least one federal court has considered the matter, at least obliquely, holding that RESPA disclosures must be made “within three days of the application, . . . not at closing when it may be literally or at least practically too late for the borrower to use the information . . . RESPA (and TILA) require an ‘up front’ disclosure, at the application stage — not the closing stage — of the loan process.” (Anderson v Wells Fargo Home Mtge., 259 F Supp 2d 1143, 1147 [WD Wash].) This language suggests that the three-day requirement was intended to be consistent with the preconsummation standard in TILA.
Applying this principle to the present case is not straightforward. As noted above, the lock-in agreement and the New York regulations governing them are both silent on the applicability of federal law. Although both TILA and RESPA preempt any inconsistent state law, neither of these statutes nor the Anderson case deals with lock-in agreements.
The defendant, no doubt aware of the silence of the statute, has argued that the fees are not enforceable because the lock-in agreement is not a binding contract, simply an agreement to agree. The court finds this unpersuasive. The better interpretation, in fact, is that so far from being a mere agreement to agree the lock-in agreement is the functional equivalent of a mortgage commitment. It sets out all the substantive provisions of a mortgage: the property secured, the interest rate, the principal and the duration of payments. It is a lock-in agreement in a double sense. The applicant obtains assurance that she will have the benefit of a particular interest rate; but once she signs the lock-in agreement she is also “locked in” to a particular mortgage lender. All that is left is the information-gathering needed to complete a credit check and to conduct the appraisal.
It would clearly violate the purpose behind TILA and RESPA to allow fees to be levied before all disclosures were made. To do so would be to postpone the disclosure obligation until it was “literally or at least practically too late for the borrower to use the information.” Reading these statutes together, it is clear that they aim at providing consumers with all information deemed relevant to a credit decision before the consumer risks any money. A posttransaction disclosure would be pointless at best and a mockery at worst; what good would it do to reveal important details of the transaction when it would cost $1,200 for the borrower to change his mind? For that reason, the court holds that contracts to pay fees such as the lock-in agreement must be preceded by all the disclosures that federal law requires. In a real sense the lock-in agreement is more akin to a consummation of the process than it is to a mere preliminary stage.
This is the only way that the disclosures required by TILA and RESPA would be of any use to the consumer. It would be manifestly improper for the defendant to be penalized for changing her mind on the basis of information supplied pursuant to that federal law. (She also claims that she had not realized until this disclosure that she was dealing with a mortgage broker; this is an error, as plaintiff is a mortgage banker — something of a hybrid, but licensed to act as a bank with respect to mortgages.) She did so in a timely fashion, as well. Regardless of the timing of the disclosures vis-a-vis the application, the defendant told the plaintiff that she wished to discontinue the transaction as soon as she received the document. There is no reason not to honor her decision.
The court therefore orders the complaint dismissed, with costs.",0

Alexander W. Hunter, Jr, J.
Defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaints of 13 plaintiffs, on the ground that they are barred by expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, is granted in part. Defendant’s motion for an order pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), disinissing all nine complaints on the ground that they fail to state a cause of action, is denied.
In each of the nine causes of action, plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death. All of the plaintiffs live or lived near the vicinity of the Pelham Bay Landfill in Bronx County and all are suffering from various types of cancer which plaintiffs allege are due to exposure to the landfill. .
Defendant argues that 13 of the actions should be! dismissed because they are barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs concede that of the 13, the claims involving Liesa Arisio, Sandra Irizarry, Joan Kohn, Rosalie Nessen, Patricia Nonnon, Nicholas Parmigiano, Rosemarie Phillips, Theresa Sebastian, ánd Susan Zietlin are time-barred. Plaintiffs further concede that the wrongful death claims relating to the DaBenigno sisters and the loss of services claim should also be dismissed as no causal relationship between the deaths of the two women and the landfill has been made. Therefore, those claims are all dismissed. There is dispute between the parties as to whether or not the claims of Christopher Angelilli are time-barred. ;
As to the claims of Christopher Angelilli, defendant argues that he was an infant at the time of diagnosis in July 1980 and since more than one year and 90 days have elapsed between the time he turned 18 and the time he commenced his qction, his claim is time-barred. Defendant asserts that the statute of limitations as to Mr. Angelilli was tolled and did not begin to run against him until his 18th birthday on July 17, 1989 and thus he had only until October 17, 1990 to commence his action. Defendant contends that he commenced his suit on or about January 15, 1991. Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Angelilli had been diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) as a child and was undergoing treatment. He filed his notice of claim on January 18, 1990, which plaintiff argues is within one year from the discovery of the cause of his ALL.
All parties agree that CPLR 214-c is applicable to this cause of action. Plaintiffs contend that CPLR 214-c (3) states that in an action such as this where there is a requirement tiiat a notice of claim be filed and which is for “personal injury or injury . . . caused by the latent effects of exposure to any substance or combination of substances, in any form . . . shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the discovery of the injury by the plaintiff or on the date when through the exercise of reasonable diligence the injury should have been discovered, whichever is earlier.”
Moreover, CPLR 214-c (4) states that notwithstanding the aforementioned provision, “where the discovery of the cause of the injury is alleged to have occurred less than five years after the discovery of the injury or when with reasonable diligence such injury should have been discovered, whichever is earlier, an action may be commenced or a claim filed within one year of such discovery of the cause of the injury . . . .” Defendants contend that to avail himself of CPLR 214-c (4), Mr. Angelilli had to establish a causal connection between his disease and defendant’s actions by July 17, 1994.
Plaintiffs contend that they may introduce testimony that defendant’s negligence was a possible cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries. Plaintiffs’ experts have determined that there is a high probability that the plaintiffs’ cancers were caused by their continued and prolonged exposure to the landfill. The defendant has not provided the court with any evidence to indicate that the plaintiffs did not get their diseases from the landfill. Mr. Angelilli filed his notice of claim on January 18,1990, when he was three months over the age of 18. The court agrees with plaintiffs’ contentions that he timely filed his claim. Therefore, Mr. Angelilli’s claim is not time-barred.
Defendant further argues that all nine causes of action should be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. Defendant contends that plaintiff has been unable to assert a causal connection between defendant’s conduct and the injuries of the plaintiffs and did not do so until February 2002 when the affidavits of experts were attached to opposition papers. Defendant cites to a report by plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Richard Neugebauer which was a part of another case which was handled by plaintiffs’ counsel and which involved the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. That report is clearly inapplicable to the case at bar. Defendant offers no other evidence in support of its assertion that plaintiffs have been unable to assert a causal connection between the landfill and the plaintiffs’ injuries. Defendant further based its dismissal motion on the original complaint filed in the actions and not the third amended verified complaint which plaintiffs aver is the correct complaint and which asserts that the landfill caused plaintiffs’ injuries. Thus, defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action is inadequate and is, therefore, denied.",0
0847-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Marcy S. Friedman, J.
In this defamation action, plaintiff Latrell Sprewell, a National Basketball Association player for the New York Knickerbockers basketball team (Knicks), sues defendants NYP Holdings, Inc., the publisher of the New York Post, and its sportswriter, Marc Berman, for allegedly libeling him in a series of articles published in October 2002 in the Post. Defendants move, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. j
At issue are four allegedly libelous articles published by the Post on October 4, 5, 7, and 8, 2002, all of which involved an incident on plaintiff’s yacht in which he fractured his fifth metacarpal. The articles discussed the circumstances under which the injury occurred, including eyewitness accounts that Sprewell took a. swing at a guest, missed and hit a ¡wall, and Sprewell’s denial of such events. The articles also discussed Sprewell’s delay in reporting the injury to Knicks’ management, and the Knicks’ response to the injury or delay in reporting it. The October 8 article reported that “[fled up with the saga surrounding Sprewell’s broken right hand and, more importantly, his failure to inform the club about the injury for two weeks,” the Knicks fined Sprewell $250,000 and banned him from contact with the team for an indeterminate period.
The complaint alleges generally that the articles were “published with actual malice, exposing Mr. Sprewell to public ridicule, contempt, aversion, disgrace, and induced evil opinions of him in the minds of right-thinking persons.” (Complaint $1i 44, 56, 68, 80.) The complaint also alleges that thfe articles defamed Sprewell in two specific respects — first, that the articles “impl[y] that Mr. Sprewell committed the crime of assault and/or battery” and second, that the articles “tend to injure Mr. Sprewell in his trade, business or profession by implying that Mr. Sprewell deliberately concealed an injury, thus violating his employment contract with the Knicks.” (Complaint 1145 [Oct. 4 article]; H 57 [Oct. 5 article]; 11 69 [Oct. 7 article]; 1Í 81 [Oct. 8 article].)
In moving to dismiss, defendants contend that the articles are not defamatory per se. In the alternative, defendants argue that even if some of the statements are susceptible to a defamatory meaning, they are not libelous per se and therefore are not actionable without proof of special damages. Defendants further contend that plaintiff has not adequately pleaded special damages.
Defamatory Meaning
It is well settled that “a written statement may be defamatory ‘if it tends to expose a person to hatred, contempt or aversion, or to induce an evil or unsavory opinion of him in the minds of a substantial number of the community.’ ” (Golub v Enquirer/Star Group, 89 NY2d 1074, 1076 [1997] [internal quotation marks omitted].) “Whether particular words are defamatory presents a legal question to be resolved by the court in the first instance.” (Aronson v Wiersma, 65 NY2d 592, 593 [1985]; Golub, 89 NY2d at 1076.) Where the statements are defamatory per se, there is no need for the plaintiff to allege special damages, as the jury can find that such statements “in and of themselves and without regard to any extrinsic evidence, tend ‘ “to expose the plaintiff to public contempt, ridicule, aversion or disgrace, or induce an evil opinion of [him] in the minds of right-thinking persons.” ’ ” (Pontarelli v Shapero, 231 AD2d 407, 411 [1st Dept 1996], quoting Rinaldi v Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 42 NY2d 369, 379 [1977], cert denied 434 US 969 [1977].)
In moving to dismiss plaintiffs defamation claims based on the imputation that plaintiff committed a crime, defendants acknowledge that statements imputing a crime may constitute libel per se, making proof of special damages unnecessary. (See Morsette v Final Call, 278 AD2d 81 [1st Dept 2000]; Clemente v Impastato, 274 AD2d 771 [3d Dept 2000].) Defendants argue, however, that the statements at issue “could not as a matter of law constitute libel per se because they could not be presumed to have had any impact on plaintiffs reputation,” given that his “public reputation already includes a more violent, highly publicized physical attack on his coach, EJ. Carlesimo.” (Reply mem at 6; mem in support at 23-24.) More particularly, defendants argue that in evaluating whether statements constitute libel per se, the court may consider not only the statements themselves, but also extrinsic facts presumably known to the articles’ readers, and that in light of highly publicized coverage of the prior incident involving Sprewell’s choking of his former coach, the articles at issue, referring to conduct that is minor in comparison, cannot be presumed to have increased the damage to Sprewell’s reputation. (Id. at 23-24.)
The standards for determining whether statements are reasonably susceptible to a defamatory connotation are well articulated: “[T]he court must give the disputed language a fair reading in the context of the publication as a whole.” (Armstrong v Simon & Schuster, 85 NY2d 373, 380 [1995].) “The courts ‘will not strain’ to interpret such writings ‘in their mildest and most inoffensive sense to hold them nonlibelous.’ ” (November v Time Inc., 13 NY2d 175, 178 [1963] [internal quotation marks omitted].) Rather, “[t]he publication will; be tested by its effect upon the average reader ... ‘It is the duty of the court ... to understand the publication in the same manner that others would naturally do.’ ” (James v Gannett Co., 40 NY2d 415, 419-420 [1976].) Significantly, while the very definition of libel per se requires that a statement be libelous on its face and without regard to extrinsic facts (Pontarelli v Shapero, 231 AD2d 407 [1996], supra), it has long been held that extrinsic facts may be considered in determining whether a writing is libelous per se where ""the extrinsic facts are “presumably known to [the] readers” of the statement. (Hinsdale v Orange County Publs., 17 NY2d 284, 290 [1966]; Sydney v MacFadden Newspaper Publ. Corp., 242 NY 208, 214 [1926].) This latter precept is based on the “reasonable, common-sense idea that a fact not expressed in the newspaper but presumably known to its readers is part of the libel.” (Hinsdale, 17 NY2d at 290.)
At the outset, the court rejects defendants’ argument that the imputation of a crime to plaintiff cannot as a matter of law further damage his reputation. As both plaintiff and defendants agree (mem in support at 23; mem in opposition at 12), and as the case law holds, this court may take judicial notice of the widespread publication of articles concerning the 1997 incident involving Sprewell’s alleged choking of his former coach, Carlesimo, during a practice. Considering the statements in the Post articles in light of the reporting of this former incident, which is presumably known to the average sports reader (see Hinsdale, 17 NY2d at 290), the court concludes that the prior publicity not only does not support, but cuts against, defendants’ argument that a further imputation of violent conduct to plaintiff cannot increase the damage to Sprewell’s reputation.
Turning to the merits of plaintiff’s claim that the articles impute a crime, the court holds that the articles contain statements which are reasonably susceptible to a defamatory connotation in that they impute to plaintiff the commission of an attempted assault. Although the articles do not expressly charge plaintiff with having committed this crime, defamatory language “need not consist of the technical words of a criminal indictment” provided that it is “reasonably susceptible to a connotation of criminality.” (Caffee v Arnold, 104 AD2d 352, 353 [2d Dept 1984] [slander].) The articles include statements that plaintiff reportedly “took a swing” at a guest, missed and hit a wall (Oct. 4 article); that eyewitnesses reported that he “busted the hand during a skirmish Sept. 20th during a booze-fest on his yacht” (Oct. 7 article); that “[w]ith evidence mounting [that] Sprewell fractured his right pinkie by punching a wall during a Sept. 20 altercation at a party on his new yacht, this could be the final straw in his often-stellar but always controversial Khick career” (Oct. 5 article); and that he sustained a “boxer’s fracture which can only occur when a clenched fist hits a surface with no give” (Oct. 7 article). The October 4 article also reported that he “asked his guests not to mention the incident,” followed immediately by the information that “[n]o police report was filed.”
The statements in the Post articles, read as a whole (see Armstrong, 85 NY2d at 380), are susceptible to the defamatory connotation that plaintiff committed a crime of violence. Not only may they be read as imputing an act of violence to plaintiff but, based on the statements that plaintiff asked his guests not to mention the incident and that no police report was filed, an average reader could understand that a crime could or would have been charged had plaintiff not obtained the silence of the eyewitnesses.
While defendants acknowledge that the articles are arguable susceptible to the connotation that plaintiff committed an attempted assault, defendants apparently contend that this crime, a misdemeanor, is not sufficiently serious to support a claim of libel per se. (See mem in support at 21-22.) The stajndards for determining whether the imputation of a crime is defamatory per se have largely been developed in slander cases. (See, e.g., Liberman v Gelstein, 80 NY2d 429 [1992].) These cases, which may provide guidance to the court in a libel action (see Golub v Enquirer/Star Group, 89 NY2d 1074 [1997], supra [libel action citing Liberman]), hold that only statements regarding serious, as opposed to minor, offenses are actionable as defamation per se. (Liberman, 80 NY2d at 435.) Such serious crimes as murder, burglary, larceny, arson, rape, and kidnapping fall squarely within the list of crimes that are actionable as slander per se. (Id.) However, the courts have held that a serious misdemeanor may form the basis for a claim of defamation per se particularly where, as here, it involves a crime that puts another! in fear of physical harm. (See DeFilippo v Xerox Corp., 223 AD2d 846 [3d Dept 1996] [stalking/first degree harassment, a class B misdemeanor], lv dismissed 87 NY2d 1056 [1996]; see also Sweeney v Prisoners’ Legal Servs. of N.Y., 146 AD2d 1 [3d Dept 1989], appeal dismissed 74 NY2d 842 [1989] [accusation th,at prison guard participated in incident in which inmate was ¡assaulted without justification held susceptible to defamatory connotation]; compare Liberman, 80 NY2d at 436 [holding harassment insufficient to support claim of slander per se under ¡prior law which made harassment a violation, not a misdemeanor].)
In so holding, the court notes that a recent case, Burdick v Verizon Communications (305 AD2d 1030 [4th Dept 2003]), considered the defamatory connotation of statements that the plaintiff, while engaged in a labor protest, “ ‘hit’ or ‘took a swing at’ a woman crossing the picket line in her car.” The Court held that such statements were not reasonably susceptible to a connotation of criminality, and were therefore not actionable as libel per se without proof of special damages. While the statements bear facial similarities to those in the instant case, they also differ in material respects. There is no indication in the Burdick opinion that the plaintiff used significant physical force. Indeed, it is unclear whether he swung at the woman or her car. Nor does it appear that the Burdick statements included any suggestion that the plaintiff had avoided a criminal charge. Most importantly, Burdick involved an isolated incident. In the instant case, the imputations of violence and criminality in connection with the incident may be interpreted by the average reader in light of the widespread publicity as to plaintiffs prior acts of alleged violence.
Under these circumstances, the court finds that the statements in the Post articles may be read as imputing the crime of attempted assault to plaintiff, and that this crime is sufficiently serious, in the context of the prior publicity, to be actionable as libel per se. In any event, as the court further holds below, plaintiff has adequately pleaded special damages.
Plaintiffs alternative claim is that the Post articles defamed plaintiff in his business or profession “by implying that he deliberately concealed an injury, thus violating his employment contract with the Knicks.” It is well settled that “[t]o be actionable as words that tend to injure another in his or her profession, the challenged statement must be more than a general reflection upon [the plaintiffs] character or qualities. Rather, the statement must reflect on [his] performance or be incompatible with the proper conduct of [his] business.” (Golub, 89 NY2d at 1076.)
The Post articles contain statements that “the Knicks weren’t worried how Spree hurt the hand. They were angry he didn’t report it sooner and wanted to know his thought process before deciding whether to fine him” (Oct. 4 article); that evidence was “mounting [that] Sprewell fractured his right pinkie by punching a wall during a Sept. 20 altercation” (Oct. 5 article); that “in possibly failing to give ‘prompt notice’ to the Knicks about his off-season hand injury, [Sprewell] might have breached his Knick contract” (id.); that Sprewell “didn’t inform the Knicks about the injury until 10 days later — is that prompt?” (id.); that “Sprewell will have to come up with a whale of a performance ... to get out of another fine from the Knicks when he goes face to face” with Knicks’ management (Oct. 7 article); that he “may have breached his contract by trampling all over a clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement by not reporting his injury promptly” (id.); and that “[c]ommunicating with his superiors ultimately may turn into Sprewell’s downfall as a Knick.” (Id.) The articles also recounted other instances in which Sprewell failed to communicate with management, such as missing a “shootaround” and not calling to sáy he had overslept; missing a 1999 Charleston training camp “because after his civil trial in Oakland for reckless driving, he Redded to drive cross-country back home and was out of touch”| (Oct. 7, 8 articles); and routinely failing to show up for games under the 90-minute limit (Oct. 8 article).
In moving to dismiss the defamation claims based on the statements concerning delay in reporting his injuries, defendants argue that the statements do not “necessarily reflect on plaintiffs performance as a professional athlete.” (Mem in support at 16.) Specifically, they contend that the articles did not charge Sprewell with “deliberately” concealing his injury, but rather suggested that the delay in reporting it was “simply one in a pattern of incidents in which Sprewell had simply neglected to follow, or chosen not to follow, the rules of Knická management.” (Id. at 18-19.) Alternatively, defendants argue ¡that even if the articles could be read “as stating that Sprewell had violated his contract by deliberately concealing an injury . . . such statements would still not constitute libel per sje because such reports would be of a single instance of professional misconduct and therefore privileged under the ‘single instance’ rule.” (Id. at 19.) ,
The court finds that plaintiffs performance as a professional basketball player requires not merely physical fitness and skill, but adherence to the rules for team members and to his responsibilities as a Knick. Thus, the statements implying that Sprewell delayed in reporting his injury — whether such delay was deliberate or merely negligent — “reflect on [his] performance or [are] incompatible with the proper conduct of [his] business.” (See Golub, 89 NY2d at 1076.) The court accordingly holds that the statements are susceptible to a defamátory connotation that tends to injure plaintiff in his business or profession.
Moreover, this is not a case in which the “single¡instance rule” applies to require the pleading of special damages. Under this rule, “ ‘language charging a professional [person] with ignorance or mistake on a single occasion only and not accusing [him or her] of general ignorance or lack of skill cannot be considered defamatory on its face and so is not actionable unless special damages are pleaded.’ ” (Bowes v Magna Concepts, 166 AD2d 347, 347 [1st Dept 1990], quoting November, 13 NY2d at 178.) Here, however, the Post articles presented three other instances of plaintiff’s disregard of Knicks’ rules and, as defendants themselves acknowledge, the delay was reported as “one in a pattern of incidents.” (Mem in support at 18.)
In sum, this court concludes that the statements in the Post articles are reasonably susceptible to a defamatory connotation, and that such statements would, if believed by the jury, constitute libel per se. Even absent pleading of special damages, it would therefore be for the jury to determine whether the statements are in fact defamatory. (See Morsette, 278 AD2d at 82; see also James, 40 NY2d at 419.) The court further holds, however, that plaintiff’s pleading of special damages is sufficient to withstand this motion to dismiss.
Special Damages
It is settled that “[s]pecial damages contemplate ‘the loss of something having economic or pecuniary value.’ ” (Liberman, 80 NY2d at 434-435 [internal quotation marks omitted].) “In pleading special damages, actual losses must be identified and causally related to the alleged tortious act.” (L.W.C. Agency v St. Paul Fire & Mar. Ins. Co., 125 AD2d 371, 373 [2d Dept 1986].) “[T]hey must be fully and accurately identified ‘with sufficient particularity to identify actual losses.’ ” (Matherson v Marchello, 100 AD2d 233, 235 [2d Dept 1984] [citation omitted].)
Contrary to defendants’ contention, plaintiff alleges special damages resulting from the publication of the Post articles, in the form of the Knicks’ imposition of a $250,000 fine upon plaintiff. The complaint thus states: “On October 7, 2002, the Knicks imposed a fine on Mr. Sprewell. Upon information and belief, this fine was the result of the negative campaign created by Defendants and based upon false information.” (Complaint H 32.) It further states: “By reason of Defendant NYP Holdings’ publication of Libelous Article One . . . Mr. Sprewell sustained special damages including, but not limited to, a $250,000 fine imposed upon Mr. Sprewell by the Knicks.” (Id. 11 47.) Special damages are pleaded for each cause of action against defendants. (See id. 1Í1Í 59, 71, 83.)
The complaint identifies the Knicks’ fine as a specific, identifiable pecuniary loss, and alleges a causal relationship between the articles’ publication and that loss. (See Liberman, 80 NY2d at 434-435; L.W.C. Agency, 125 AD2d at 373.) The complaint thus pleads that the Knicks’ fine flows “directly fromj the injury to reputation caused by the defamation, not from thé effects of defamation.” (Matherson, 100 AD2d at 235, quoting Sack, Libel, Slander and Related Problems § VII.2.2, at 345-346.) =
Defendants misapprehend plaintiffs burden on thjis motion. “[TJhere is no requirement that the plaintiff establish an evidentiary basis for the allegations of the complaint on a motion to dismiss made pursuant to CPLR 3211.” (Matherson, 100 AD2d at 238-239; Palmisano v Modernismo Pubis, j 98 AD2d 953 [4th Dept 1983].) Thus, defendants’ apparent contention that the Knicks’ decision to fine plaintiff resulted from his conduct in failing promptly to report his injury, rajther than from the published articles (see mem in support at 26), is irrelevant to whether the complaint adequately pleads special damages. Instead, it merely raises factual issues inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss under CPLR 3211 (q) (7). (See Fischbach & Moore v Howell Co., 240 AD2d 157 [1st Dept 1997].)
It is accordingly hereby ordered as follows: Defendants’ motion is denied in its entirety. !
. The articles bore the following headlines: October 4 — “SpLee Denies Breaking Hand in Boat Fracas”; October 5 (at 44) — “Spree Might Have Broken Knicks Deal”; October 7 (at 58) — “Sprewell Leaves Don by Phone”; October 8 (at 74) — “A Fine Mess[,] Fed-up Knicks hit Spree for 250G.” A second October 5 article, which is not referred to in the complaint, was captioned “Spree Might Have Punched Knick Ticket.” Defendant Berman’s name is on the bylines of the October 4, 5, and 7 articles. Nonparty Mark Hale appears on the byline of the October 8 article. ,
. While the complaint identifies the imputed crime as “assault and/or battery” (complaint K 45), under the civil law, assault is an intentional attempt to cause injury to another, and battery is an intentional wrongful physical contact with another. (6A NY Jur 2d, Assault-Civil Aspects § 1.) The criminal law, in contrast, uses the term assault, not battery, for the crime of intentional wrongful physical contact with another (see Penal Law § 120.00 et seq.), while attempted assault is the intent to commit the crime of assault. (See Penal Law § 110.00.) Here, only attempted assault is imputable to plaintiff, as he did not make physical contact with the guest at whom he allegedly swung.
. Misdemeanors involving moral turpitude have also been held sufficient to support a claim for slander per se. (See Meyer v Somlo, 105 AD2d 1007 [3d Dept 1984] [adultery]; Casper v Lew Lieberbaum & Co., 1998 WL 150993, 1998 US Dist LEXIS 4063 [SD NY, Mar. 31, 1998, Koeltl, J.] [applying New York law; prostitution and sodomy]; see generally Privitera v Town of Phelps, 79 AD2d 1 [4th Dept 1981], appeal dismissed 53 NY2d 796 [1981].)
. It is noted that the court’s holding is not that the statements implying that plaintiff breached his contract are libelous per se. Rather, it is the statements concerning the nature of the breach — namely, failure to comply with Knicks’ rules regarding the reporting of injuries — that bear directly on plaintiffs performance as a professional basketball player and thus directly tend to injure him in respect to it.",0
0857-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Henry J. Nowak, J.
Procedural History
The instant criminal actions arise out of three separate informations, all verified on April 16, 2003, concerning three properties in the City of Buffalo located at 366 Hudson, 162 Allen, and 26 Orton (the subject properties). The informations allege that defendant installed exterior gas meters in a historic preservation district without an appropriate certificate from the Buffalo Preservation Board, in violation of Code of City of Buffalo § 337-16 (C). Defendant moves to dismiss these actions, alleging (1) that New York state law preempts the City of Buffalo from issuing and enforcing this section of the City Code, and (2) that the City Code must be stricken down to the extent that ijt is inconsistent with state law. Defendant also claims that the allegations are vague and that the charges should be dismissed in the interest of justice, because cost and safety considerations should prevail over the aesthetic concerns raised by the City of Buffalo.
Factual History
In 1994, National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation began replacing low pressure gas main lines in front of homes throughout Buffalo’s historic preservation districts with medium pressure main lines. As part of the upgrade of gas services, National Fuel relocated the meters along the gas service lines from the inside to the outside of the buildings, -including those at the subject properties. National Fuel performed such work pursuant to its tariff from the Public Service Commission, which provides the following:
“Meters shall be located in a reasonably accessible and a convenient position as determined by the company. If at any time after the installation of a meter the company determines that the metef is not in a reasonably accessible, convenient, or safe location, the company shall have the right to move the meter and any other facilities to a suitable Ideation at the expense of the property owners.”
The primary reason given by defendant for the placement of meters in front of the buildings at the subject properties is that such placement “reduces costs for rate payers because there is considerably less pipe to install and it facilitates easy meter access, i.e., allowing meters to be read without internal jaccess to the structure.” National Fuel noted that a secondary reason is easier accessibility in the event of a fire or other emergency that requires the gas service to be shut off.
National Fuel never formally applied to the Buffalo Preservation Board before the placement of the meters at the subject properties, or any other properties in the City of Buffalo’s historic preservation districts. Nonetheless, National Fuel met with City representatives concerning the placement of meters on several occasions, and agreed to a plan whereby National Fuel would notify the City of Buffalo Department of Law of any proposed meter installations in writing, and then a copy would be forwarded to the Buffalo Preservation Board for review. If there were any concerns regarding the installation, the Buffalo Preservation Board could contact the Superintendent for National Fuel, Michael R Allexenberg. Nonetheless, there is no evidence in the record that representatives of the Buffalo Preservation Board and National Fuel ever specifically discussed the placement of meters at the subject properties.
Application of Law
The instant actions present an issue of first impression— should a local preservation law be stricken when it conflicts with a tariff granted to a gas corporation by the Public Service Commission?
The City of Buffalo’s authority to legislate is derived from article IX (§ 2 [c]) of the New York State Constitution, which provides that “every local government shall have power to adopt and amend local laws not inconsistent with the provisions of this constitution or any general law . . . except to the extent that the legislature shall restrict the adoption of such a local law.” To implement article IX, the New York State Legislature enacted the Municipal Home Rule Law, which empowers cities to enact local laws for the “protection and enhancement of its physical and visual environment” and for the “government, protection, order, conduct, safety, health and well-being of persons or properties therein” (Municipal Home Rule Law § 10 [1] [ii] [a] [11], [12]).
The specific local law at issue is chapter 337 of the Code of the City of Buffalo, known as the “Preservation Code.” The purpose of the Preservation Code is set forth in section 337-1 (A):
“It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy that preservation, protection, conservation, enhancement, perpetuation and utilization of sites, buildings, improvements and districts of special character, historical or aesthetic interest or value are necessary and required in the interest of the health, education, culture, prosperity, safety and high quality of life of the people.”
To that end, the Preservation Code authorizes the Buffalo Preservation Board to “approve or disapprove certificates of no effect, certificates of appropriateness or certificates of exception for the erection, alteration, restoration, renovation, relocation, demolition or site improvement of any landmark, landmark site or of any building, structure or site within an historic district when the exterior of such property would be affected!’ (Code of City of Buffalo § 337-5 [F]). Any decision by the Buffalo Preservation Board may be appealed to the City of Buffalo Common Council (see, Code of City of Buffalo § 337-26).
A local law may be preempted when it either directly conflicts with a state statute, or when the local government legislates in the field for which the State Legislature has assumed full regulatory responsibility (see, DJL Rest. Corp. v City of New York, 96 NY2d 91, 95 [2001]). Such assumption of regulatory responsibility may be express or implied, and implied intent ma# be found by either a declaration of policy or the enactment of a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme in a particular area by the State Legislature (id.). Also, a local law may be stricken as inconsistent with state law if it “prohibits conduct which the State law . . . considers acceptable or at least does not! proscribe . . . or . . . imposes additional restrictions on rights granted by State law” (id. at 95).
Defendant contends that once a tariff is approved by the Public Service Commission, it takes on the full force and effect of state law, relying upon Sisters of St. Dominic v Orange & Rockland Power Co. (79 AD2d 1021 [2d Dept 1981]) and Lo Vico v Consolidated Edison Co. (99 Misc 2d 897 [App Term, 2d Dept 1979]). The City of Buffalo does not dispute this claim. Notwithstanding the language of the tariff giving National Fuel the authority to determine the location of its meters, Public Service Law § 65 (1) requires National Fuel to “furnish and provide such service, instrumentalities and facilities as shall be safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable.”
In support of its claim that preemption applies in the instant case, defendant would have this court follow Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v City of New Rochelle (140 AD2d 125 [2d Dept 1988]). In that case, the local law required that gas service line installations on private property be performed by licensed plumbers (id. at 128). After reviewing the legislative history, the Court held that Public Service Law § 31 (4) preempted further regulation concerning the new installation of gas service lines for private residential buildings, and that the local law was inconsistent with state law (id. at 133-134).
This court agrees with the Second Department that the Legislature has enacted a regulatory scheme in the area of gas service line installation, preempting local laws that directly impact that regulatory scheme, such as the local law in Consolidated Edison Co. v City of New Rochelle. But the local law in this case differs from a law that specifically addresses how gas service line installations are performed; the local law in this case addresses the preservation of historic neighborhoods.
The Court of Appeals has articulated an exception to the doctrines of preemption and inconsistency: “[l]ocal laws of general application — which are aimed at legitimate concerns of a local government — will not be preempted if their enforcement only incidentally infringes on a preempted field” (DJL Rest. Corp., 96 NY2d at 97). In DJL Rest. Corp., the Court considered a local law that created a zoning requirement for adult establishments in New York City (id. at 93). Owners of several of the affected adult establishments claimed that the local law was preempted by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which governed their business operations because they served alcohol on their premises (id.). But the Court held that the local law was not specifically regulating alcohol consumption (id. at 97). While there was no dispute that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law preempted the field of regulation over the plaintiffs’ establishments, the local law applied across the board to all adult establishments, regardless of whether they sold alcohol (id.).
Because the local law was found to be directed at addressing a separate and distinct problem, its impact on the state law was found to be merely incidental (id.; see also Seaboard Contr. & Material v Town of Smithtown, 147 AD2d 4, 8 [2d Dept 1989]). In this case, the Preservation Code is not directed at the regulatory scheme for the installation of gas service lines or meters under the Public Service Law, and its impact is similarly incidental.
The Court of Appeals further noted that separate levels of regulatory oversight can coexist when local laws have only a tangential impact on state statutes (DJL Rest. Corp., 96 NY2d at 97). As noted in People v De Jesus (54 NY2d 465, 471 [1981]), an establishment selling alcoholic beverages would not be exempt from a local law requiring smoke alarms, ¡forbidding dumping of refuse on sidewalks, or prohibiting disorderliness.
Therefore, this court finds that defendant must comply with the Preservation Code and is required to seek approval by the Buffalo Preservation Board when altering the exterior of structures in historic preservation districts. Insofar as National Fuel has already agreed to a procedure to facilitate such review with the City of Buffalo Department of Law, the burden on defendant National Fuel under the circumstances is not so extensive as to warrant dismissal in the interest of justice.
Consequently, defendant’s motions to dismiss ate denied. Furthermore, pursuant to Laws of 1978 (ch 516, §¡204), this court is empowered to “recommend or employ any remedy, program, procedure or sanction authorized by law for the enforcement of housing standards, if it believes they will be more effective to accomplish compliance or to protect and promote the public interest.” Accordingly, defendant jis ordered to apply to the Buffalo Preservation Board for a certificate of appropriateness, certificate of exception, or a certificate of no effect in regard to the gas meters at the subject properties, within 30 days of the date of this order. ,",0
0681-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Jack M. Battaglia, J.
In each of these commercial nonpayment proceedings, petitioner applies for a judgment of possession pursuant to RPAPL 732 (3) by reason of the tenant’s failure to answer. Although the petitions differ in structure and pertinent language, each is verified only by an attorney based on information and belief. None of the applications are accompanied by any other affidavit or affirmation, with the consequence that none of the allegations of any of the petitions is sworn to or affirmed to be true by anyone with personal knowledge. In this respect, these applications, which constitute four of the six applications submitted to this judge on a recent day in the appropriate part, resemble a significant majority of the applications for judgment of possession regularly submitted for his determination. Finding the attorney verification insufficient to support a judgment of possession and warrant, the court denies each of the applications, with leave to renew.
This opinion will not address whether the verifications in these petitions comply with RPAPL 741 and, to the extent required, CPLR 3020 and 3021; nor will it address whether any defect in the verification would preclude entry of a default judgment. (See, generally, Genesee Gateway Houses, Inc. v Khalid, 2003 NY Slip Op 50809[U] [Rochester City Ct]; Ft. Holding Corp. v Otero, 157 Misc 2d 834 [Civ Ct, NY County 1993]; Zirinsky v Violet Mills, 152 Misc 2d 538 [Civ Ct, Queens County 1991]; Cucinotta v Saljon Enters., 140 Misc 2d 681 [Civ Ct, NY County 1988]; Lefrak v Robinson, 115 Misc 2d 256 [Mount Vernon City Ct 1982]; S.P.S.G., Inc. v Collado, 113 Misc 2d 167 [Civ Ct, NY County 1982].)
In Matter of Brusco v Braun (199 AD2d 27 [1st Dept 1993], affd 84 NY2d 674 [1994]), the First Department considered the authority of a judge to schedule an inquest following the tenant’s default in answering a nonpayment proceeding. Authority for the inquest was claimed to flow from CPLR 3215 (b), which establishes the procedure before the court for obtaining a default judgment generally, and which permits the court to “make an assessment or take an account or proof.” A provision in the RPAPL that specifically governs nonpayment proceedings, however, states that, upon the tenant’s failure to answer, “the judge shall render judgment in favor of the petitioner.” (RPAPL 732 [3].)
“Applying the rules of statutory construction to the conflicting provisions,” the First Department concluded that “it is clear that CPLR 3215 is inconsistent with, and thus superseded by, the provisions of RPAPL 732.” (Brusco v Braun, 199 AD2d at 31.) Although the inconsistency identified in Brusco was created by the provision for inquest in subdivision (b) of CPLR 3215, the First Department appears to hold that no provision of CPLR 3215 is applicable to summary proceedings. Specifically, the court’s treatment of prior case law clearly indicates that subdivision (f) of CPLR 3215 does not apply. (See id.)
CPLR 3215 (f) requires that an application for a default judgment be supported by “proof by affidavit made by the party of the facts constituting the claim . . . and the amount due,” but a “verified complaint . . . may be used as the affidavit.” An application for default judgment pursuant to CPLR 3215 is properly denied when based upon a complaint verified only by an attorney, rather than upon an affidavit of facts or a complaint verified by someone with personal knowledge of the facts. (See Drake v Drake, 296 AD2d 566 [2d Dept 2002]; Fiorino v Yung Boon Yung, 281 AD2d 513 [2d Dept 2001]; Finnegan v Sheahan, 269 AD2d 491 [2d Dept 2000].) “[A] complaint verified by counsel amounts to no more than an attorney’s affidavit and is therefore insufficient to support entry of judgment pursuant to CPLR 3215.” (Mullins v DiLorenzo, 199 AD2d 218, 219 [1st Dept 1993].)
Even though, however, CPLR 3215 (f) may not be applicable, “[t]he standards governing motions for summary judgment are applicable to special proceedings generally ... of which the summary proceeding to recover possession of real property is a species.” (Brusco v Braun, 199 AD2d at 31-32.) On summary judgment, the “bare affirmation” of an attorney, which is not based upon personal knowledge of the facts, is “without evidentiary value.” (See Zuckerman v City of New York, 49 NY2d 557, 563 [1980]; Feratovic v Lun Wah, Inc., 284 AD2d 368, 368-369 [2d Dept 2001].) The “information and belief’ of the attorney adds nothing (see Henriquez v Putins, 245 AD2d 337, 338 [2d Dept 1997]; Wood v Nourse, 124 AD2d 1020, 1021 [4th Dept 1986]), even when based upon the attorney’s review of the client’s file (see Park Health Ctr. v Green Bus Lines Inc., 2002 NY Slip Op 40029[U], *3 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]). The record before the Court in Brusco “reveal[ed] no defect in the supporting papers. The petition was personally verified by the owner.” (Brusco v Braun, 199 AD2d at 31.)
The result is that a court’s refusal to enter a default judgment in a nonpayment proceeding when the application is supported only by a petition verified by the petitioner’s attorney is sustainable. (See Brusco v Braun, 199 AD2d at 32.) “While RPAPL 741 permits a petition to be verified by an attorney for the landlord, it is well settled that the affidavit of counsel [has] no probative value for purposes of summary determination . . . unless accompanied by documentary evidence.” (Id.) The court may require the “submission of ‘additional proof in the form of an affidavit from someone in the position of landlord or managing agent, attesting to the amount of rent currently due and owing.” (Id., quoting CPLR 409 [a].) In light of “statistics . . . regarding the frequency with which summary proceedings are discontinued because rent has been tendered or the matter otherwise settled . . . the submission of such an affidavit at the time default judgment is requested is a procedure which has much to commend it.” (Id.)
The Court of Appeals affirmed the First Department in Brusco, also relying on the inconsistency between CPLR 3215 (b) and RPAPL 732 (3). (See Brusco v Braun, 84 NY2d at 681.) The Court did not address verification of a petition by an attorney, but twice noted that the petition in the case before it was verified on personal knowledge by the landlord. (See id. at 678, 681.) As characterized in a subsequent opinion, the Court ruled that judges “lack[ ] the discretionary legal authority to . . . fashion ... an additional procedural safeguard, as a matter of policy, for the benefit of defaulting tenants in a rental nonpayment eviction proceeding, beyond the policy choices made by the Legislature in this regard.” (Matter of Mennella v Lopez-Torres, 91 NY2d 474, 479 [1998].)
The notion that judicial action be based upon facts sworn to or affirmed to be true on personal knowledge, or found to exist from otherwise admissible evidence, is not merely an “additional procedural safeguard, as a matter of policy.” It is a pervasive characteristic of our judicial process, and of long-standing rules of practice and procedure, contributing substantially to legitimacy. No reason commends itself to suggest that the Legislature intended to withdraw from the scope of such a fundamental precept judicial action of such serious consequence as judgments and warrants of eviction.",0
0825-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Debra Rose Samuels, J.
Petitioner, who is 50 years old, was born anatomically male and was given a traditionally masculine name, which remains petitioner’s legal name to this day. Petitioner’s Pennsylvania birth certificate identifies petitioner as male. Petitioner is married to a woman.
On March 27, 2002, petitioner applied to the court pro se, pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 60, for leave to assume a new name, stating that the change of first name was intended to help implement a sex change, while the change of last name was intended to alleviate employment discrimination.
On April 23, 2002, the court denied the application “without prejudice to renew with statement regarding marital status/ children and proof, i.e., physician’s affirmation, of ihe completion of the sex change operation.”
In support of a renewed application, petitioner submitted a sworn statement attesting that petitioner was married and had no children; a notarized “Consent” to the proposed change of name from petitioner’s wife; and an unsworn letter from a physician and a certified social worker, both affiliated with the Michael Callen-Audre Lorde Community Health Center. The letter stated that
“Cynthia A. Frank, a.k.a. Frank Guido has been followed at our practice since December 2000 for a condition known as Gender Identity Disorde^. Ms. Frank, although born physically male, is actually psychologically female. As a result of her continuing treatment to resolve this conflict, we have determined that her psychological gender (i.e. female) predominates over her physical gender. ;
“Ms. Frank is now and has been for some time pursuing a program of gender reassignment. Part of this treatment includes living and working fulli-time as a woman. It is therefore important to her treatment, career, and lifestyle that she obtain vital documents that identify her as female. It is especially important for her driver’s license to reflect he]) current female gender. ■
“Ms. Frank’s treatment at present includes taking female hormones to help feminize her body and counseling to help her adjust to her adopted fqmale gender.
“In conclusion, we fully recommend that Ms. Cynthia Frank be provided with documentation that identifies her as a female, her predominant gender.”
In a decision/order dated September 25, 2002, the court denied the application, stating that such denial was
“without prejudice to renew upon completion of gender reassignment surgery and divorce froth his wife. Under the present state of the law, same-sex marriages are not recognized. It would therefore be inconsistent for this court to grant the relief requested, to permit the applicant to appear! and represent himself as female, while in fact he remains in a legal relationship with his wife premised on his being male.” .
The court cited Matter of Anonymous (155 Misc 2d 241 [Civ Ct, Queens County 1992]), in which the court denied a name change application intended to help implement a change of sex, explaining that
“In considering whether the court should grant the within application for a change of name, the court has the responsibility to determine whether the proposed change will lead to fraud, misrepresentation, confusion, deception or otherwise interfere with the rights of the public. (Matter of ‘Shipley’, 26 Misc 2d 204.) The petitioner has failed to set forth sufficient facts upon which the court can make such a determination. He merely states in his petition that the purpose of changing his name is ‘to avoid embarrassing situations due to my sexual preference and physical well being’. The petitioner does not corroborate this claim by competent medical and psychiatric evaluation, including whether he is a transvestite or a transsexual and, if a transsexual, whether he has undergone a sex change operation and is now anatomically and psychologically a woman . . .
“The within application is, therefore, denied because, without such supportive evidence, the change of name from a ‘male’ name to a ‘female’ name would be fraught with danger of deception and confusion and contrary to the public interest. (Matter of Jevens, NYLJ, Oct. 18, 1976, at 15, col 4.)” (155 Misc 2d at 242.)
On this renewed application, made with the assistance of counsel, the court is persuaded that, in its prior approach to this application, informed by Anonymous (supra), the court concerned itself with matters outside the scope of the court’s jurisdiction and beyond the scope of the inquiry necessary to avoid lending the court’s assistance to fraud, deception or other interference with the rights of third parties.
In its previous denials, the court required evidence of sex reassignment surgery (which petitioner has apparently not had) and expressed concern about the legal conundrum presented by petitioner’s prospective change of sex from male to female while still married to a woman, while New York — despite considerable ferment in this area of the law — continues to sanction marriage only between people of the opposite sex. With the assistance of petitioner’s persuasive memorandum of law, however, the court has concluded that its concern with both issues was misplaced, as they anticipate questions that simply are not raised by this application.
Petitioner has not asked this court to declare his sex changed from male to female, nor is such a declaration withijn the scope of this court’s powers. This court is asked only to sanction legally petitioner’s desire for a change of name, after satisfying itself that petitioner has no fraudulent purpose for doing so and that no other person’s rights are interfered with thereby. The court is satisfied on those questions. The law does! not distinguish between masculine and feminine names, which are a matter of social tradition. Some names are traditionally associated with one gender; some with the other; some with either. And, as pointed out by petitioner, the gender association of s.ome names has changed over time. Apart from the prevention ¡of fraud or interference with the rights of others, there is no reason — and no legal basis — for the courts to appoint themselves: the guardians of orthodoxy in such matters.
Whether petitioner has, in fact, effected a legally, cognizable change of sex and, if so, the implications of such ¡change for petitioner’s marriage (and the legal rights and responsibilities attendant thereto of both spouses), are questions that await resolution in another forum, in a case in which such questions are actually presented. In the accompanying order, the court, aware of its own jurisdictional limitations, has specified tha,t the order “may never be utilized as evidence of a court acknowledgment of a change in sex from male to female.” (See Matter of Rivera, 165 Misc 2d 307, 311 [Civ Ct, Bronx County 1995].)",0

Paul A. Victor, J.
Relief Requested
Motion by defendant Hedco, Inc., doing business as Hedco Associates, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross claims asserted against it; or in the alternative for an order limiting, as a matter of law, the percentage of any of its potential liability to plaintiff to no more than 50% of any recovery pursuant to CPLR article 16 (CPLR 1601, 1602). Codefendants DelValle and Lopez join in plaintiffs opposition to Hedco’s motions.
Issues Presented
1. Did defendant Hedco by its actions create “a peculiar unreasonable risk” of injury to plaintiff, an employee of an independent contractor (Con Edison), and thereby subject itself to liability under an exception to the general rule which precludes liability for the harm caused by acts of independent subcontractors? In other words, did defendant Hedco, by its actions, bring itself within the “orbit of a duty” owed to plaintiff?
2. Was the accident caused solely by the intervening and superceding act of the codefendant DelValle,. or were the actions of defendant Hedco a contributing concurrent proximate cause of the accident?
Procedural History and Background
Plaintiff Michael Macario sues to recover for personal injuries sustained as the result of an automobile accident which occurred on the morning of January 23, 2001, in front of 1144 Zerega Avenue, in Bronx County where defendant Hedco maintained its business offices, machinery and related facilities. Macario was standing on the street side of a double-parked 40-foot Con Edison tractor-trailer when he was struck by an automobile which was driven by defendant Virginia DelValle and owned by defendant Faustino Lopez. The tractor-trailer was double-parked on the northbound side of Zerega Avenue facing into traffic, near the intersection of Zerega and Powell Avenues. Zerega Avenue is a two-way street with only two lanes of moving traffic and parking on both sides. The traffic at the time of the accident was described as “pretty heavy.”
Plaintiff Macario testified at his deposition that he and Nataliño Giraldi, both working as employees of Con Edison, had been assigned to load an experimental backhoe, known as an “EarthForce,” onto the tractor-trailer to transport it to another location for use. This experimental backhoe was in the possession and control of defendant Hedco, and Hedco had loaned it to Con Edison on several occasions in an effort to obtain future sales. Macario further testified that a representative of Hedco, identified as a “Mr. Crane,” came out of the Hedco company offices and gave Giraldi and him “directions” to take the backhoe from the back of the Hedco facility and to load it outside on the street. Giraldi drove the backhoe off the Hedco property, down onto Zerega Avenue and into the Con Edison tractor-trailer. Plaintiff testified that, as he stood in the street directing Giraldi up the ramp into the trailer-box of the Con Edison truck, he was injured when struck in the right shoulder by the side view mirror of the vehicle which was being operated by defendant DelValle. Plaintiff explained that in order for northbound vehicular traffic to get around the double-parked Con Edison tractor-trailer, vehicles were required to cross the yellow traffic divider line and proceed into the southbound lanes for approximately the distance of the tractor-trailer, that is, some 40 feet. Plaintiff also testified that Hedco’s “Mr. Crane” was on the sidewalk at the location during the loading of the backhoe and was there when the accident actually occurred.
Plaintiff testified that each time they came for the backhoe, either “Mr. Crane,” or a mechanic named “Bob,” whom “Mr. Crane” first called over, was present when they loaded the backhoe on their truck. He also stated that it was his understanding that he and Giraldi were required to get permission from “Mr. Crane” to bring their truck down the driveway onto Hedco’s property. On the date of the accident, “Mr. Crane” specifically told him and Giraldi to load the backhoe on the public street, Zerega Avenue, where the accident ultimately occurred. Hedco does not refute that, on the day of the accident, its employee told the Con Edison representatives to “take the machine and load it in the front.” Hedco acknowledged that its employee Stephen Krines was in front of Hedco’s facilities, with or near plaintiff, while the loading of the backhoe was in progress.
Hedco now moves for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, as well as cross claim of defendants DelValle and Lopez, contending that it owed no duty of care to the plaintiff and should not be held to be at fault for the happening of the accident. Hedco alleges, among other things, that plaintiff and Giraldi independently chose to double-park on Zerega Avenue; that it was codefendant DelValle who owed a duty to safely operate her vehicle; and that the breach of this duty was the sole proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff.
Applicable Law
Summary Judgment Issues
The court’s function on this motion for summary judgment is issue finding rather than issue determination. (Sillman v Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 3 NY2d 395 [1957].) Since summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it should not be granted where there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue. (Rotuba Extruders v Ceppos, 46 NY2d 223 [1978]; Sillman v Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., supra; Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., 68 NY2d 320 [1986].)
The Finding of a Breach of Duty as a Precurser to a Finding of Fault
In 1928, Chief Judge Cardozo, writing for a unanimous bench, coined the axiom, “The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed ...” (Palsgraf v Long Is. R.R. Co., 248 NY 339, 344 [1928]). Thus, it became “axiomatic” that before a party can be held to be at fault, the court must initially determine whether the alleged offending party owed a duty of care to the injured party.
In order to keep the “orbit” of imposed duty to reasonable and legally manageable limits, the court is admonished to consider the consequences of imposing a duty under the facts and circumstances presented. As explained by Judge Fuchsberg in his concurring opinion in Sewar v Gagliardi Bros. Serv. (51 NY2d 752 [1980]):
“Duty, as we have seen, is essentially a legal term by which we express our conclusion that there can be liability. Simply, it tells us whether the risk to which one person exposes another is within the protection of the law. The determination of that question may take into account not only the facts in the particular case, but also, generally though not necessarily, foreseeability ... As Chief Judge Cardozo had occasion to put it, ‘the orbit of the duty’ is ‘at times a question for the court, and at times, if varying inferences are possible, a question for the jury’ (Palsgraf v Long Is. R.R. Co., 248 NY 339, 343, 345 [1928]).” (51 NY2d 752, 758 [1956], supra [citations omitted and emphasis added].)
Acts of Independent Persons or Entities
Generally, a person or entity is not responsible for the acts of others over whom one does not retain a measure of control. Unlike an employer/employee relationship, an owner or employer or other person who contracts with an independent contractor to engage in an activity is ordinarily not responsible for the tortious acts of the independent contractor even though said acts are committed while engaged in carrying out the engagement. (Chainani v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., 87 NY2d 370 [1995].) In Chainani, the Court of Appeals held that the defendant Board of Education of the City of New York could not be held vicariously liable for the tortious acts committed by a bus driver who was employed by an independent contractor which provided transportation services for the students pursuant to a contract with the defendant. In Chainani the Court explained the general rule, and several of its exceptions, including the inherently dangerous task exception which is often invoked by plaintiffs, but infrequently held to apply by the courts. (See for example, Baraban v Orient Express Hotels, 292 AD2d 203 [1st Dept 2002] [setting up electrical equipment in a public place was not inherently dangerous so as to render the principal vicariously liable for the contractor’s negligence]; Robinson v Jewish Hosp. & Med. Ctr. of Brooklyn, 275 AD2d 362 [2d Dept 2000] [anesthesiology held not to be inherently dangerous work]; see also Kozinevich v Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 201 AD2d 462 [2d Dept 1994].)
It would appear therefore that the ordinary and routine task of transporting a backhoe would not qualify as “inherently dangerous” per se; and in the absence of any retained control over the method of transportation, an owner would be absolved of any responsibility for a tortious act committed by an independent contractor that was hired to transport same.
Among the factors to be considered in order to determine if an owner’s alleged participation in an activity has created an actionable legal duty, and/or whether a contractor is truly “independent,” is the extent of supervision or control, if any, exercised by an owner over the employee of an independent contractor and/or over the work to be performed by said employee. As explained by the Appellate Division in Marin v San Martin Rest. (287 AD2d 441, 441-442 [2d Dept 2001]):
“ [A]n owner does not owe a duty to protect a contractor’s employee from hazards resulting from the contractor’s methods over which the owner exercises no supervisory control’ (Anderson v Bush Indus., 280 AD2d 949, 950; Comes v New York State Elec. & Gas Corp., 82 NY2d 876) . . .
“When a worker ‘confronts the ordinary and obvious hazards of his employment, and has at his disposal the time and other resources (e.g., a co-worker) to enable him to proceed safely, he may not hold others responsible if he elects to perform his job so incautiously as to injure himself . . . (Citations omitted and emphasis added.)
However, if an owner alters the independent contractor’s methods and exposes said contractor’s employee to more than the ordinary and obvious hazards of his employment, might the owner be held responsible for harm which results from said employee’s incautious acts? Although the mere act of transporting a backhoe may not per se qualify as inherently dangerous, there is a significant body of law which provides another exception to the general rule where an owner by its acts creates a “peculiar unreasonable risk” and takes no “special precautions” to minimize that risk. (See, Restatement [Second] of Torts §§ 413, 414; Wilson v Good Humor Corp., 757 F2d 1293, 1303-1306 [DC Cir 1985]; Prosser and Keeton, Torts § 71, at 512 [5th ed].) The Restatement (Second) of Torts (supra) describes this exception to the general rule as follows:
“413. Duty To Provide For Taking Of Precautions Against Dangers Involved In Work Entrusted to Contractor
“One who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create, during its progress, a peculiar unreasonable risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the absence of such precautions if the employer
“(a) fails to provide in the contract that the contractor shall take such precautions, or
“(b) fails to exercise reasonable care to provide in some other manner for the taking of such precautions.” (Emphasis added.)
In Chainani (supra), the New York Court of Appeals stated that [w]e have not previously adopted or rejected this Restatement exception and find it unnecessary to do so here.” (87 NY2d 370, 382 [1995], supra.) Thus, according to the New York Court of Appeals, this exception appears to be an open issue in New York, and no New York appellate court has yet unequivocally adopted the Restatement exception.
This court now holds that the doctrine of “peculiar unreasonable risk” as expressed in section 413 of the Restatement is a natural and practical consequence of the common law of this state, and that the rule is consonant with the law of this state and should be accepted and adopted as expressing a valid rule of law. Clearly, although an employer of an independent contractor may not actively direct the manner in which the work is performed, the employer’s special directions may create unusual hazards for which the employer is liable in tort. As stated in Comment b accompanying Restatement (Second) of Torts § 413, “This Section is concerned with special risks, peculiar to the work to be done, and arising out of its character, or out of the place where it is to be done, against which a reasonable ¡person] would recognize the necessity of taking special precautions.” (Emphasis supplied.) Consequently, when an employer refuses to permit activities by an independent contractor to be performed on its premises, and knows that the undertaking of those activities in the public street would pose an unusual and peculiar risk of injury, liability would be imposed under this section, if no special precautions are undertaken.
In any event, even-where the exception can be applied and a defendant thereby held to be responsible for an independent contractor’s acts, a finding of fault is not automatic, since plaintiff must still establish that defendant’s negligence was a substantial cause of the harm which resulted. In other words plaintiff must establish the second element of fault — proximate cause.
The Second Element of Fault — Proximate Cause
It is fundamental that no act, although tortious, is actionable unless it is also a proximate or legal cause of harm to plaintiff. However, proximate cause, the required second element of fault, has been long recognized as being impossible to precisely define so as to cover all situations. (Derdiarian v Felix Contr. Corp., 51 NY2d 308 [1980]; Prosser, Torts § 42, at 249 [4th ed].) Its application becomes even more elusive when, for “policy considerations,” courts are required “to place manageable limits upon the liability that flows from negligent conduct.” (Derdiarian v Felix Contr. Corp., 51 NY2d, supra at 314; Palsgraf v Long Is. R.R. Co., supra.) As observed in Derdiarian (at 314-315): “Depending upon the nature of the case, a variety of factors may be relevant in assessing legal cause. Given the unique nature of the inquiry in each case, it is for the finder of fact to determine legal cause, once the court has been satisfied that a prima facie case has been established . . . .” (Emphasis added.)
The “legal cause” issue becomes even more complex when the acts of third persons “intervene” between the negligent conduct of the defendant and the ultimate injury to plaintiff. When this occurs the defendant always alleges that the intervening act was the sole proximate cause of the event, and requests that plaintiffs claim against defendant be dismissed. However, as also explained in Derdiarian (supra), “the causal connection is not automatically severed . . . [and] liability turns upon whether the intervening act is a normal or foreseeable consequence of the situation created by the defendant’s negligence.” (Derdiarian v Felix Contr. Corp., 51 NY2d, supra at 315 [emphasis added]; Toyos v City of New York, 304 AD2d 319 [1st Dept 2003].) For example, in Toyos (supra), the First Department held the negligence of the City of New York (failure to provide a roadway, shoulder or turnouts) was not superceded by plaintiff’s attempt to change a flat tire in the middle of the highway, nor was it superceded by the negligence of a driver of a vehicle which crashed into plaintiffs disabled vehicle. In Toyos the Court (at 320, quoting Derdiarian) reiterated that “[a]n intervening act, may not serve as a superseding cause, and relieve an actor of responsibility, where the risk of the intervening act occurring is the very same risk which renders the actor negligent.”
The Derdiarian line of cases makes it abundantly clear that, in order to break the legal causal nexus, the intervening act must be so extraordinary that it is not foreseeable under the circumstances presented, or that it is so independent of, and far removed from, defendant’s conduct that it would be unreasonable (for public policy considerations) to hold that said conduct was a substantial contributing factor in causing the occurrence. Unfortunately, there is often no bright line which separates the foreseeable from the unforeseeable. In many situations, the boundary between these poles is neither factually nor legally illuminated. In any event, whether an intervening act (the risk) should have been anticipated by defendant is often debatable and subject to nuances and varying inferences which are best left to a jury to resolve.
Discussion and Conclusion
The court, on the record presented herein, is unable to declare, as a matter of law, that the intervening act of DelValle was a wholly unforeseeable superceding act which could not have been anticipated by defendant Hedco. Apparently no special precautions were taken by Hedco, and it seems that Hedco did not insist that any special precautions be taken by the Con Edison employees despite being aware of the peculiar and unreasonable risks involved.
One cannot tell from the record what other resources may have been available to plaintiff and his coemployee to perform the required task in a less hazardous fashion. In any event, it seems that Hedco made no attempt to assist them in reducing the risk, which was created, at least in part, by Hedco’s insistence that the loading take place on Zerega Avenue. To be sure, fault for the happening of this accident may ultimately be attributed to the plaintiff (who could have chosen to abort the whole project), as well as to the acts of the intervening actor DelValle. However, even if both plaintiff and DelValle are found to be at fault, their acts cannot be said, as a matter of law, to supercede the conduct of Krines and to absolve Hedco from the “peculiar unreasonable risk of injury” created by its employee Krines. On this record a jury may well determine that Krines injected himself into the “orbit of duty” owed to plaintiff and subjected Hedco to the Restatement exception to the independent contractor rule. It must be kept in mind that although Hedco may not have had direct “supervision and control” over the employees of the subcontractor, it did indirectly control their activity via its control of the work site, and thus the manner in which the task could have been conducted. {See, Restatement [Second] of Torts § 414.) In any event, although the section 413 Restatement exception to the independent contractor rule is clearly applicable to the unusual hazard created here, the court finds that unresolved and mixed issues of law and fact remain as to all of the above issues, including those which impact upon the alleged duty of defendant Hedco and its corresponding alleged fault for the happening of this accident. As stated in Rotz v City of New York (143 AD2d 301, 304 [1988]), “[i]ssues of negligence, foreseeability and proximate cause involve the kinds of judgmental variables which have traditionally, and soundly, been left to the finders of fact to resolve even where the facts are essentially undisputed.” So too is the issue of duty in this case which is inextricably interwoven with all of the issues presented by this motion. The facts and circumstances presented herein do not permit this court to define that “orbit of duty” as a matter of law. Clearly this issue also involves “judgmental variables” and thus the question is one which prudence and precedent dictate should be submitted to the jury.
Hedco’s motion for summary judgment is therefore denied. Additionally, the court finds that Hedco’s requested alternative relief, pursuant to CPLR article 16, for a court order fixing its maximum liability at no more than 50% of the whole, is premature and inappropriate at this juncture; and thus that part of motion is also denied, however without prejudice, to renewal at trial. It is for the finder of the fact to determine the respective responsibility of each party.

0638-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Kenneth R. Fisher, J.
Defendant moves to reargue the suppression motions which were denied in the court’s decision and order dated July 9, 2003 (196 Misc 2d 716). The motion is made on a number of grounds, only some of which require discussion here. The following is the court’s decision and order denying the motion to reargue.
A. The directive to Mulrooney to keep the computer secure until the police arrive following the weekend was not unreasonable.
Defendant maintains that the police directive to Mulrooney on December 7th to secure defendant’s computer in Mulrooney’s shop until the police arrived on December 10th was an unlawful seizure of his property, and should lead to suppression under fruit of the poisonous tree grounds. The same argument was made in defendant’s original moving papers, and resolved against him in part D of the original decision. Defendant now posits that the seizure actually occurred on December 7th via the telephone directive, not on December 10th when the police took the computer to the station house pending issuance of the warrant the next day, and that therefore it was unreasonable in length.
While it is true that an official seizure occurred on the 7th (United States v Mayomi, 873 F2d 1049, 1053 [7th Cir 1989] [“after the government requested him to detain” the computer, Mulrooney “acted as an agent of the government”]), the original decision is adhered to. In this case, defendant entrusted his computer to Mulrooney for repairs. Defendant does not allege that the entrustment was for any particular length of time, nor does he allege that the repairs were done and that the computer was scheduled for return. Here, we are dealing with a brief four-day delay over the weekend without any expectation of return by defendant. (Compare United States v Hall, 142 F3d 988, 994 [7th Cir 1998] [delay of one day after scheduled return of computer upheld].) Courts must consider the level of suspicion involved, “the brevity of the invasion of the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests,” and “whether the police diligently pursue their investigation.” (United States v Place, 462 US 696, 709 [1983].) The reported cases arise largely in the mail context, and “have previously upheld as reasonable a detention of letters over a weekend for the purpose of subjecting them to a canine sniff.” (United States v Pitts, 322 F3d 449, 455 [7th Cir 2003], citing United States v Mayomi, 873 F2d at 1054.) “Where investigators have acted with reasonable diligence, courts have found acceptable the detention of mail for anywhere from twenty-nine hours to five days” (United States v Ramirez, 342 F3d 1210, 1212 [10th Cir, Sept. 8, 2003] [collecting cases]), particularly when a weekend is involved. (United States v Gill, 280 F3d 923, 929 [9th Cir 2002] [“(s)ignificant that the investigation began at the end of one week and was completed at the beginning of the following week”].) While the delay here would be more troubling without the weekend factor, on balance it is held reasonable, especially given the strong probable cause present, the circumstances of defendant’s entrustment of the computer to Mulrooney, and the nature of the contraband.
B. The official search did not exceed the scope of the private search even if the official search did not concern any of the image files opened by Mulrooney in his private search.
Defendant contends that there is no way to determine a relationship between the private search conducted by Mulrooney alone on December 7th, and the December 10th search conducted by the police with Mulrooney. With a clearer discussion of the mechanics involved than appeared in the original motion papers, defendant alleges that “[a]ny file accessed on December 10th, for example, could also have been accessed on December 7th.” (Freeman affirmation of Aug. 2, 2003 1i 27.) Defendant now contends, for the first time, that Mulrooney may have looked at none of the files accessed by the police on the 10th when he conducted his private search on the 7th. (Id. U 31.) Defendant reasons, again for the first time, that his discovery material is such that any file opened by the police and Mulrooney on the 10th would show a “last access” date of the 10th, and that there would be no way to determine whether Mulrooney looked at any of those files on December 7th. Defendant concludes that “it must be assumed, from the current record, that the warrantless police search on December 10th was an entirely new search, encompassing exclusively files that were not opened on the 7th.” {Id. 11 35.)
This argument is without merit. My decision of July 9 did not turn upon this particular detail, although I acknowledge that I framed the facts in the terms originally presented to me by the defendant’s moving papers (which incorporated the search warrant application). Rather, the key point is that, when Mulrooney and the police on December 10th turned the computer on, they accessed in the first instance, or at least before examination of any image file, only two file folder directories, one denominated “xxx” and the other “MPG.” These computer file folders each appear on the screen, when first opened, as a directory of folder files, or a “table of contents,” containing the titles of individual computer image files. Although defendant now contends that, on this record, we must assume that Mulrooney opened none of the files on December 7th that he and the police opened together on December 10th, the so-called table of contents pages of the two folders in question were assuredly opened by Mulrooney on December 7th (he could not access any individual image file without going through the folder directory or table of contents page). And it is equally clear that these two table of contents pages were first opened by Mulrooney and the police on December 10th (for the same reasons) before they could have opened, respectively, any image files in each folder.
Accordingly, it is clear beyond peradventure that the official search on December 10th did not, to that limited extent of accessing the directory or table of contents page, go beyond what Mulrooney did himself on December 7th. We also know, however, that Mulrooney in his private search on December 7th opened many of the files labeled as child pornography and verified that they indeed contained what the label promised. In other words, the private search of a sampling of the image files fully confirmed what the labels only provided probable cause to believe, i.e., that all of the files so labeled contained child pornography contraband. (United States v Bowman, 907 F2d 63, 65 [8th Cir 1990] [presence of contraband in the privately opened containers “spoke volumes as to (the) contents” of the remaining containers] [discussed in the court’s original decision (196 Misc 2d at 725 n 4)].) Moreover, with exception of the image files, discussed below, each folder directory was comprised largely if not exclusively of the same type and kind of image files. (Cf., United States v Carey, 172 F3d 1268, 1275 [10th Cir 1999] [“not a case in which ambiguously labeled files were contained in the hard drive directory” and thus “not a case in which the officers had to open each file drawer before discovering its contents”].)
Because of the labeling of the computer image files in each of the two “folder” directories, or table of contents pages in question, which were necessarily accessed by Mulrooney on the 7th before he could get into any of the individual image files, and because such labels were necessarily first encountered by the police and Mulrooney on December 10th before they could get into any of the individual image files, the December 10th search could not have exceeded in a functional sense the scope of the December 7th viewing by Mulrooney. Any viewing of the individual files by the police on December 10th was justified by application of the plain view doctrine, for the reasons stated in footnote 4 in my July 9th decision, and the reasons stated above. (People v Brown, 96 NY2d 80, 88-89 [2001] [“police should be able to seize incriminating evidence in plain view if they had a right to be where they were when they saw it” because “such a seizure involves no invasion beyond what the warrant (or some other exception to the warrant requirement) allows”].) Therefore, it makes no difference if indeed, as defendant now alleges, the police and Mulrooney accessed image files on the 10th that Mulrooney never opened on the 7th.
This is a different situation than that encountered in the context of simple obscenity, as opposed to child pornography. If we were only dealing with materials alleged to be obscene, the labeling, on the computer file folder table of contents page, of files as “sexually explicit” would not be enough to suggest that, in addition, the file images contained therein were obscene, because an additional finding beyond sexual explicitness, which could only occur by a viewing of the files, would have to be made. In that situation, a warrant would have to be obtained to open the individual files labeled as sexually explicit, on an additional showing beyond the labeling that obscenity may probably be present. That is the point of Walter v United States (447 US 649, 657 [1980] [from the labeling alone, “one could only draw inferences about what was on the films”]), and also the point of United States v Carey (172 F3d at 1273-1276).
In the context of child pornography, however, a labeling which clearly says that an image file contains a sexual performance by a child, in the context of Mulrooney’s earlier private search verifying the same during a sampling of the files, needs no additional viewing to determine that it is, indeed, contraband. (United States v Carey, 172 F3d at 1274-1275; United States v Bowman, supra.) And these individual file labels, in plain view on the table of contents page of each file folder in question, is what Mulrooney said he saw, and what the police said they saw, when the “xxx” file folder was opened and the “MPG” file folder was opened. Defendant’s original moving papers presupposed these facts, if they did not explicitly set them forth as the operative factual scenario. Accordingly, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the “xxx” and “MPG” computer files which are the subject of the motion to suppress which was not thoroughly frustrated by the private search on December 7th, and no evidentiary hearing was needed.
Defendant makes another allegation in his motion for reargument which requires discussion. Taking issue with the court’s finding that the “viewing of files on both dates concerned images of child pornography only,” and not “other types of private information elsewhere on the computer’s hard drive,” defendant points to the fact that one of the files examined by the police and Mulrooney on the 10th, from the “xxx” file folder, had a title indicating that it was not child pornography, but rather only pornography. Defendant contends, therefore, that “there are not facts in the record that allow the court to conclude that only the ‘xxx’ and ‘MPG’ folders were accessed during the warrantless police search” on December 10th (emphasis in original).
This argument does not support reexamination of the court’s denial of the motion to suppress. First, defendant’s motion papers made no allegation that the police ventured outside “xxx” and “MPG” file folders. Second, the critical point is that defendant’s motion to suppress only targeted for a suppression order the 43 child pornographic images which are the subject of the indictment. Nothing additional was sought to be suppressed. The motion to suppress, framed as it was in these terms, did not require examination into whether the December 10th search went beyond the “xxx” and “MPG” file folders, or included two files in the “xxx” file folder not containing child pornography. Even if it had, the remedy would be, as I pointed out in my original decision, suppression of “only the information attributable to that additional ‘search,’ ” not suppression of the results of the entire search. (United States v $557,937.89, More or Less, in U.S. Funds, 287 F3d 66, 87-88 [2d Cir 2002] [emphasis in original], quoted in n 3 of the original decision.) There is no precedent supporting suppression of those items a valid plain view search turns up simply because the police seize other items not in plain view which the People do not intend to use at trial. (United States v Rouse, 148 F3d 1040, 1041 [8th Cir 1998] [suppression ordered only of those items with respect to which the defendant did not “already ha(ve) his expectation of privacy frustrated”]; cf., in the context of severing an invalid portion of a search warrant, People v Brown, 96 NY2d at 86-87.) Inasmuch as the motion to suppress targeted only the child pornography images, and they were lawfully seized and searched in plain view, the motion for reargument is denied. Defendant’s remedy, if any, would be a motion for a return of those items improperly seized. (Waller v Georgia, 467 US 39, 44 n 3 [1984]; Andresen v Maryland, 427 US 463, 482 n 11 [1976].) For the same reasons, the fact that two image files in the “xxx” and “MPG” folders had titles not suggesting child pornography does not require reexamination of the original decision denying the motion to suppress, because defendant did not in his original motion papers seek suppression of those two image files. In any event, the People have expressed no intent to use them at trial.
Finally, defendant’s attempt to liken this situation to the prewarrant confirmatory searches condemned in Murray v United States (487 US 533, 540 [1988]) is without merit. As stated above, when the police with Mulrooney opened up the “xxx” and “MPG” file folder directories on December 10th, they necessarily first encountered a table of contents page replete with image file titles expressly announcing the presence of child pornography. Because Mulrooney had already confirmed for the police the results of his private search on December 7th, i.e., that indeed the titles were accurate for the many image files he opened on that earlier date, defendant retained no expectation of privacy in the remaining images of child pornography in those two file folders under the Jacobsen-Walter-Adler rationale (see United States v Jacobsen, 466 US 109 [1984]; Walter v United States, 447 US 649 [1980]; People v Adler, 50 NY2d 730 [1980]). Accordingly, the police were “lawfully present,” for purposes of the plain view doctrine (1 Wayne R LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on The Fourth Amendment § 2.2, at 395, and n 1 [3d ed 1996]), or in other words “they had a right to be where they were when they saw” (People v Brown, 96 NY2d at 88-89) the two file folder directory or table of contents pages. The case of Murray v United States (supra; see also, People v Burr, 70 NY2d 354, 362 [1987]) involves police acquisition of probable cause at a time when they had no right to be where they were, e.g., an illegal entry during which drugs are observed, a subsequent retreat from the premises to obtain a search warrant (leaving the contraband within), and a subsequent search pursuant to the warrant issued solely on the basis of observations made during the illegal entry. Murray and its progeny plainly have no application to an official search of items with respect to which defendant no longer enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy because of an earlier private search. Otherwise, the JacobsenWalter-Adler line of cases would be meaningless.
Conclusion
The motion for reargument is granted, and upon reargument the original decision is adhered to.
. This is just the nature of a computer’s packaging of individual image files into a “folder.” The folder table of contents page is viewed first, enabling the user to click onto (or “open”) the individual image files. By all accounts, i.e., by accounts not challenged in defendant’s original moving papers or his current moving papers, the individual image files were explicitly labeled.
. In Carey, of course, these observations about the type and kind of files in question, containing child and other pornography, were relevant to show why a police officer’s computer search of such files in aid of a drug investigation violated the Fourth Amendment. They are equally relevant to demonstrate that, even before the search on December 10th reached the point of opening up individual image files, Mulrooney knew from his December 7th private search, imparted lawfully to the police, that each file “was properly labeled and its contents were clearly described in the label.” (United States v Carey, 112 F3d at 1275.) For this reason, and the additional reason that defendant concedes that probable cause to support issuance of a warrant was fully provided by Mulrooney’s private search on December 7th, there is a sufficient record to conclude that the search warrant would have been issued anyway. (People v Del Rio, 220 AD2d 122, 131 [2d Dept 1996].) However, in view of the disposition above, and the failure of the People to argue the independent source point, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to reach this issue.",0

In this special proceeding, petitioner seeks leave to serve a late notice of claim, pursuant to General Municipal Law § 50-e (5).
Petitioner, a police officer, asserts that he was injured by exposure to toxic substances in the course of his work related to the rescue and recovery operations at the World Trade Center from September 11, 2001 until June 2002. He alleges, inter alia, that the City did not provide him with proper respiratory or protective equipment.
Statutory Standard
It is well settled that, when considering an application for leave to file a late notice of claim, the court should consider several factors, including: (1) the reasonableness of the claimant’s excuse for not having filed a notice of claim during the 90-day period after the claim arose; (2) whether the municipality obtained actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim within that 90-day as-of-right filing period or within a reasonable time thereafter; and (3) whether the municipality was prejudiced because the claimant did not file during the as-of-right period. (See, generally, General Municipal Law § 50-e [5].)
A court must use common sense and logic in applying its discretion as part of the statutory analysis. The standard used to decide a motion for summary judgment under CPLR 3212 does not apply to this proceeding for leave to file a late notice of claim under General Municipal Law § 50-e (5). The standard applicable here does not require the claimant to demonstrate ultimate entitlement to judgment; neither does the existence of significant factual questions respecting exposure, negligence, causation, contributory conduct or injury prevent the relief sought here: ability to serve a document that would permit claimant to commence an action against the City.
I
Petitioner claims that he began experiencing breathing problems on or about March 14, 2002, but that he was unaware of the severity of his symptoms, which included bronchitis, until he was hospitalized from January 20, 2003 until February 6, 2003.
Petitioner indicates that he first contacted his attorney on May 13, 2003.
Significantly, it appears that petitioner did not run to file a notice of claim the first day he experienced respiratory symptoms. Rather, it would seem that petitioner waited to see if the condition, including symptoms resembling a cold or flu, would resolve. Petitioner should not be penalized for not rushing to sue before having a good-faith basis to claim tortious injury. To hold otherwise would encourage preemptive filing of notices of claim by claimants who have no good-faith bases for believing that they were actually injured.
Under all the circumstances, petitioner has shown a reasonable excuse for the delay.
II
Given the unprecedented circumstances of the destruction of the World Trade Center and the clearing of the site thereafter; the well-publicized allegations of toxic substances in the smoke and debris (despite well-publicized assurances by the federal government that the air quality met safety standards); the remarkably similar health claims of many workers, both City and private employees, involved in the rescue, clearance and transportation work related to the site and its debris; and the hundreds of other site workers’ claims that the City did not provide them with appropriate respiratory and other protective equipment; it is not reasonable for the City to assert that the City did not have notice of the nature and substance of this claim within a reasonable time after the 90-day as-of-right filing period.
The investigation of environmental concerns by various levels of government, and the intense media attention and public discussion of the working conditions, air quality and the composition of World Trade Center debris and the smoke and fumes emanating from the debris, bely the City’s contention that it was surprised by petitioner’s notice of claim and that it did not obtain actual knowledge of the nature of petitioner’s claims respecting the City’s alleged acts and omissions. (See, Matter of Annis v New York City Tr. Auth., 108 AD2d 643 [1st Dept 1985] [coverage of a train wreck by the media, and subsequent investigation by the Transit Authority, held grounds to permit service of late notice of claim relating to injuries caused by the accident].)
The court is not determining here that there was a hazardous condition at the site, or that the City knew that a hazardous condition existed there. The City presumably knew if petitioner was assigned there, and during what periods. The City would have known what duties the City had assigned to petitioner and what equipment the City issued, offered or told him to use. It appears undisputed that the City secured and monitored the site. Petitioner has made a sufficient showing on this application that the City was aware of the issues raised here regarding alleged toxic substance exposure and alleged lack of appropriate equipment, within a reasonable period after December 11, 2001.
The City’s continued ability to investigate and analyze the environmental data and the particular circumstances surrounding the World Trade Center cleanup means that the City will have an objective opportunity to test claimant’s allegations and prepare a defense. Unlike many alleged conditions that are not objectively verifiable or that have disappeared over time because of a claimant’s delay, the City will be able to verify, inter alia, what substances were present and what equipment it issued to whom at the site (see, e.g., Chechelnitskaya v City of New York, 293 AD2d 700 [2d Dept 2002]).
Although the City asserts that its general awareness of other individuals’ complaints did not put the City on notice of petitioner’s specific health claims, it cannot be said that the City did not have actual knowledge of the circumstances underlying petitioner’s claim within a reasonable period of time after the 90-day post-September 11 period had run. (See, Taha v City of New York, 192 Misc 2d 244 [2002].) The statutory requirement that the City have “essential facts constituting the claim” does not require that the proposed notice of claim contain a detailed bill of particulars respecting petitioner’s alleged injuries. (See, Teresta v City of New York, 304 NY 440 [1952]; Matter of Dubowy v City of New York, 305 AD2d 320 [1st Dept].)
Petitioner has set forth a sufficient showing of actual notice as envisioned under General Municipal Law § 50-e (5).
m
Petitioner’s delay in bringing this application did not prejudice the City. It neither prevented nor hampered any attempt that the City could have made to investigate the substance of petitioner’s claim. Unlike many late notice of claim applications, the delay here had no effect on the City’s capacity to investigate, defend or correct an allegedly hazardous condition, or to verify or refute a claimed ephemeral or transitory condition.
Moreover, the City’s right to conduct comptroller’s examinations under General Municipal Law § 50-h, an essential part of the statutory scheme, assures that the City will be given an opportunity to explore all of those issues thoroughly even prior to commencement of an action.
Conclusion
The papers before the court provide ample basis for concluding that the City had, within its control, within a reasonable time after the 90-day as-of-right filing period, information that placed it on notice, or should have placed it on notice, of the nature and substance of petitioner’s claims, both of the City’s alleged acts and omissions, and of the health complaints of petitioner, which are characteristic of those of many other site workers, including uniformed services members, whose recurrent cough and other symptoms were well documented and apparently brought to the City’s attention. Under the unusual circumstances of this case, petitioner has adequately demonstrated his statutory burden under General Municipal Law § 50-e (5).
Accordingly, it is ordered and adjudged that the petition is granted and the notice of claim is deemed timely filed and served in the form annexed to the petition.
. It is unnecessary for this court to determine at this time whether the statute of limitations should be measured under CPLR 214-c.
. Although claimant will ultimately have the burden of proving every element of the tort claim in the plenary action, claimant would not have that burden in an application for an award from the federal compensation fund. The deadline for applying to the fund is December 22, 2003.
. The slow manifestation of various symptoms and the diagnosis of various conditions among workers at and around the World Trade Center site has been widely reported in the media. The term “World Trade Center cough” quickly entered the language as referring to a recurrent cough, characteristic among site workers, that sometimes did not resolve, and was followed later, in some cases, by a diagnosis of a respiratory condition.
. Because it relates to the issues of foreseeability and standard of care under the unique and changing conditions at the site, what the City knew or reasonably believed, and when, will likely be highly relevant at trial. Information, including representations by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency — whether accurate or not — supplied to the City, and relied on by the City and by other levels of government, must be explored during disclosure.
. The City cannot be presumed to know about any instructions that may have been given to City personnel at the site by the military or employees of the federal or state government, or anyone else who may have participated in managing the site or the performance of work.
. This court granted several hundred other individual applications for leave to file late notices of claim by City workers (which applications were not opposed by the City), at the same site, under the same alleged conditions, whose claims were also based on the City’s alleged failure to supply respirators or other safety equipment.",0

James D. Pagones, J.
The Attorney General of the State of New York has filed a petition seeking a decree directing beneficiaries of certain Totten trusts created by the decedent to refund those moneys to the estate in order to pay a claim of the Office of Mental Health. It coincides with a final accounting submitted by the estate representative.
The relevant facts are not in dispute. Decedent died intestate on October 8, 1989 survived by an adult daughter and a spouse from whom he had been estranged for over 35 years. A decree granting letters of administration to the daughter was issued on April 26, 1990. Pursuant to 22 NYCRR 207.20, the administratrix filed an affidavit of property on or about November 30, 1990. The personal property listed consisted of six Totten trust accounts totaling $181,525.21, savings bonds payable on death to decedent’s daughter valued at $13,750, a health insurance refund of $675.07 and three motor vehicles with a total value of $2,600. On November 2, 1992, over three years after the decedent’s death, a claim against the estate for the sum of $352,158.58 was filed by the New York State Attorney General on behalf of his client, the New York State Office of Mental Health. The claim was filed under Mental Hygiene Law § 43.03 (a) for services provided to the decedent’s estranged wife, Elaine LaPine, from January 1, 1984 through January 31, 1991. The statute imposes liability for fees incurred by the patient on various individuals, including the spouse. The claim was deemed rejected pursuant to SCPA 1806 (3) when the administratrix failed to allow the claim within 90 days following its presentation.
On July 23, 1999, almost 10 years after decedent’s death, petitioner entered judgment against the administratrix of this estate in a civil action commenced in Supreme Court, Albany County, based on an order granting summary judgment, dated May 27, 1999. On May 3, 2000 the Attorney General filed a petition under SCPA 2205 to compel the administratrix to file an account. The accounting was filed on December 6, 2000. This proceeding to compel the refund of the Totten trust funds was not filed until December 11, 2002. The administratrix and trust beneficiaries have filed papers in opposition relying on laches and statute of limitations as a shield.
The proceeds of the Totten trusts were distributed to the named beneficiaries prior to petitioner’s filing of the claim in November 1992. No proceeding was instituted in this court to determine the validity or amount of the asserted claim. Instead, petitioner exercised his right to litigate that issue in the Supreme Court, Albany County, even though the estate and administratrix are located in Dutchess County. Moreover, the Attorney General has an office here in Poughkeepsie. The Tot-ten trust beneficiaries were not parties to that action and had no opportunity to challenge the validity or amount of petitioner’s claim.
The New York State Constitution commands “the Surrogate’s Court shall exercise such equity jurisdiction as may be provided by law.” (NY Const, art VI, § 12 [e].) That authority is found in SCPA 201 (2). Subdivision (3) of the same statute further provides that the Surrogate’s Court “shall continue to exercise full and complete general jurisdiction in law and in equity to administer justice in all matters relating to estates and the affairs of decedents” and to render determinations which will make “a full, equitable and complete disposition of the matter.” The surrogate has far-reaching jurisdiction relating to the estates and affairs of decedents. (Matter of Lyon, 266 NY 219 [1935]; Matter of Foley, 199 AD2d 672, 673 [3d Dept 1993].) Equity, in its broadest sense, is grounded in “fairness, justness and right-dealing.” (55 NY Jur 2d, Equity § 1.) Equity delights to do justice. (Edmonds v Ronella, 73 Misc 2d 598, 599 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1973].)
The thrust of the Attorney General’s position is based on the fact that the decedent and Elaine LaPine were still married on October 8, 1989. While the couple was married in the legal sense on the day Anthony LaPine died, it is irrefutable they had been physically and emotionally separated for over three decades.
It is worth noting that if the issue was litigated in Surrogate’s Court, there could have been a finding that Elaine LaPine was disqualified from exercising her right of election as a surviving spouse following a hearing pursuant to EPTL 5-1.2 (a) (5). The Attorney General under those circumstances would then have no legal basis to pursue his claim on behalf of the Office of Mental Health. It is not surprising, therefore, that the claim was submitted to the Supreme Court.
It is settled that creditors may reach funds in a Totten trust if other assets of a decedent’s estate have been exhausted.. (Matter of Mirsky, 154 Misc 2d 278, 280-281 [Sur Ct, Bronx County 1992].) The Attorney General urges the statute of limitations defense is unavailing. Once the claim against the decedent’s estate was reduced to a money judgment in the Supreme Court action, his client has 20 years to enforce it under CPLR 211 (b). A rigid application of this rule would have a tremendous detrimental effect on the trust beneficiaries under the unique facts of this proceeding. The ends of justice and equity will not be achieved were I to overlook petitioner’s indolence so as to require the Totten trust beneficiaries to refund money almost 14 years after the decedent’s death and at least 11 years after the funds were distributed. It would render worthless the use of Totten trusts as an acceptable form of testamentary substitute. Trust beneficiaries would have to wait 20 years to use the trust funds if I were to follow the Attorney General’s logic. Justice under the facts of this proceeding requires the rejection of such an argument. Issues of fundamental fairness, as well as petitioner’s failure to act in a timely fashion, mandate a finding in favor of the trust beneficiaries in opposition to the petition.
For the foregoing reasons the petition is denied. The accounting is approved as submitted.",0

Louis B. York, J.
The plaintiffs are a theatre and. video store whose stock includes videos and movies containing adult materials. The court has extensively analyzed the background and history of the New York City Zoning Resolution in the companion case of Ten’s Cabaret v City of New York (1 Misc 3d 399 [2003]).
Plaintiffs, who are establishments that would be affected by this law, bring this motion for a preliminary injunction. As in Ten’s, plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the 2001 amendments to the Zoning Resolution.
As in Ten’s and Pussycat Lounge v City of New York (Index No. 122740/02), defendants also cross-move for summary judgment. A municipality can regulate uses through its zoning power if it can establish that
“(1) the ‘predominant purpose’ of the ordinance is not to control the content of the material purveyed but to control the ‘secondary effects’ of such uses on the surrounding community, (2) the ordinance is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest, (3) it is narrowly tailored to affect only the category of uses that produce the unwanted effects and (4) it allows for reasonable alternative avenues of expression.” (Matter of Town of Islip v Caviglia, 73 NY2d 544, 552 [1989].)
Using this general standard, to survive, the 2001 amendments must be “justified by concerns unrelated to speech” and only as broad as needed to achieve its purpose.
Here, defendants have not established the constitutional requirements necessary to grant summary judgment in their favor. The 2001 amendments broaden the definitions of “adult establishments,” “adult bookstore,” and “adult eating or drinking establishment.” These expansive definitions are broader than needed to achieve the City’s purpose of ameliorating negative secondary effects. (Id.)
The 2001 amendments redefine “adult establishment” as “a commercial establishment which is or includes an adult bookstore, adult eating or drinking establishment, adult theater, or other adult commercial establishment, or any combination thereof.” (NY City Zoning Resolution § 12-10.) These amendments necessarily include the plaintiffs. Therefore, the standards applicable to the plaintiffs in the consolidated Ten’s action also apply here. Thus, as in Ten’s and Pussycat, the City needs to provide evidence that supports this drastic change to the 1995 NY City Zoning Resolution. The City admittedly has not researched the negative secondary impacts of 60/40 establishments:
“Council Member McCaffrey: [I]n essence there is no need for additional studies of secondary impacts that were cited in the Council at that time of the [1995] adoption, is that correct?
“Mr. Karnovsky: That’s correct.
“Council Member McCaffrey: What about with the 60-40 rule?
“Mr. Karnovsky: We are not quite sure that the 60-40 — you cannot change the text without doing another study to see that establishments of that nature have secondary impacts.” (Zoning and Franchises Subcomm of City Council Meeting, Oct. 1, 2001, at 37-38.) Also, in a letter from the Department of City Planning to the City’s Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee, the City again acknowledged that it did not conduct a study of 60/40 establishments:
“[N]o such study [of secondary impacts of 60/40 establishments] has been prepared in connection with the proposed amendments, for the simple reason that none is necessary.
“[T]he sole purpose of the amendments as they relate to topless bars and restaurants is to allow the City to implement the regulations according to their original intent. No new study or analysis is needed to do so.” (Letter from Karnovsky to McCaffrey of Oct. 24, 2001 at 1, 3.)
Whether or not the 2001 amendments are a clarification, the City would need to perform another study in order to assess whether 60/40s cause negative secondary impacts.
The City has not shown that the “predominant purpose” of the 2001 amendments is to control negative secondary effects. Instead, as in Ten’s, the court accepts plaintiffs’ position that the 2001 amendments are facially unconstitutional and that they control the content of the establishments they seek to regulate. (City of Los Angeles v Alameda Books, Inc., 535 US 425, 438-439 [2002].) Thus, the City has failed to meet its burden of showing a correlation between 60/40s and adverse secondary effects. (Cf. id.; Town of Islip, 73 NY2d at 575; People ex rel. Arcara v Cloud Books, 68 NY2d at 557 [1986].) For this reason, defendants’ motion for summary judgment must be denied.
Here, as in Ten’s, defendants contend that the 2001 amendments are constitutional because they have a rational basis, are narrowly tailored to remedy the secondary effects caused by adult establishments, and there are sufficient alternate locations where the adult establishments can relocate. Plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs in Ten’s and Pussycat, oppose the motion for summary judgment, challenging the constitutionality of the 2001 amendments, and arguing that the record is devoid of any evidence demonstrating a relationship between secondary effects and 60/40s, which is required under a constitutional analysis of a zoning ordinance that implicates protected speech.
Defendants assert the same arguments as they do in Ten’s: that the 2001 amendments are lawfully based on the 1993 Department of City Planning (DCP) Report because they clarified the 1995 Resolution, which was itself based on the 1993 DCP Report, and thus, a new study is unnecessary. As discussed in the Ten’s decision, defendants’ argument lacks merit because 60/40s proliferated as a result of the 1995 Resolution (City of New York v Dezer Props., 95 NY2d 771, 773 [2000]), and the 1993 DCP Report cannot be used as a basis for these new 60/ 40s.
In addition, defendants claim, as they do in Ten’s, that the 2001 amendments are a narrowly tailored solution to fix the secondary effects, which were not remedied by creating 60/40 establishments. But, the 1995 Resolution defined “adult establishment” as a commercial establishment where a “substantial portion” of the establishment includes an adult book store, adult eating or drinking establishment, adult theatre, or other adult commercial establishment. (NY City Zoning Resolution former § 12-10.) This court is not persuaded that the 2001 amendments are narrowly tailored to limit free speech, without evidence that the 1995 Resolution was not effective in correcting the problems.
Furthermore, as in Ten’s, pursuant to CPLR 3212 (e), the court grants summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs because the City has failed to meet its constitutional burden for this court to uphold the 2001 amendments. (See Goldstein v Lopresti, 300 AD2d 442, 442 [2002].) The court “searches the record” and grants summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. (Doin v Bluff Point Golf & Country Club, 262 AD2d 842, 843 [1999].) Granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs is the most efficient means to prevent unnecessary costs and delays.
In summary, defendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied, and summary judgment is granted in favor of plaintiffs, together with costs and disbursements.",0

Per Curiam.
Order entered June 5, 2002 modified to deny tenants’ motion for summary judgment and to reinstate the petition; as modified, order affirmed, without costs.
We do not disturb Civil Court’s exercise of discretion insofar as it vacated the stipulation executed by the pro se tenants and permitted them to defend the nonpayment proceeding on the merits. Tenants have made a prima facie showing of defenses based upon breach of the warranty of habitability and rent overcharge.
Tenants, recipients of public assistance, are not entitled under prevailing precedent, however, to summary dismissal of the petition on the basis of Social Services Law § 143-b (the Spiegel Law). As a sharply divided panel of the Appellate Division, Second Department, recently held in analogous circumstances, the Spiegel Law may only be raised as a defense to a proceeding or action to recover rent where the New York City Human Resources Administration “or other appropriate social services agency has exercised its right to withhold direct rent payments to landlords based upon the existence of code violations in the recipient’s building.” (Matter of Notre Dame Leasing v Rosario, 308 AD2d 164, 165-166 [2003].) While we endorse the reasoning set out in the dissenting opinion in Notre Dame Leasing (308 AD2d at 174-178) and concur with the dissenters’ conclusion that the plain language of the Spiegel Law authorizes welfare recipient tenants to raise the statute as a defense to a nonpayment proceeding in the all too common situation where a social services agency has not exercised its right to withhold rent in response to code violations, we nonetheless are constrained to follow the Appellate Division majority’s contrary holding. “The Appellate Division is a single State-wide court divided into departments for administrative convenience . . . and, therefore, the doctrine of stare decisis requires trial courts [and the Appellate Term] in this department to follow precedents set by the Appellate Division of another department until the Court of Appeals or [the Appellate Division of this department] pronounces a contrary rule” (Mountain View Coach Lines v Storms, 102 AD2d 663, 664 [Titone, J., 1984]).

Albert Tomei, J.
In this proceeding brought pursuant to article 16 of the Election Law to preserve and secure all absentee ballots, official military ballots, federal ballots, emergency ballots, and affidavit ballots, used in the special election held on February 25, 2003 for the public office of Member of the Council of the City of New York from the 43rd Council District, County of Kings, the court finds as follows:
On February 25, 2003, a special election was held for the public office of Member of the Council of the City of New York from the 43rd Council District. On February 28, 2003, the City Board of Elections conducted a recanvass of the voting machines. After the recanvass, the machine vote total for each candidate in the 43rd Council District was as follows: Rosemarie O’Keefe, 3,077 votes; Vincent Gentile, 3,043 votes; Joanne Seminara, 2,632 votes; Stephen Harrison, 751 votes; and Carlo Scissura, 674 votes. As of March 1, 2003, the City Board of Elections had received approximately 700 paper ballots, including absentee and/or military ballots, emergency ballots and affidavit ballots. The canvass of the paper ballots is scheduled to commence on Wednesday, March 5, 2003.
Under the canvassing procedure set forth in the Election Law, the paper ballots are counted by two Board of Elections inspectors (board of inspectors), one Democrat and one Republican. The board of inspectors decide, in the first instance, whether or not the information accompanying the ballot is sufficient to allow it to be counted. Section 9-209 (2) (d) of the Election Law states that any party lawfully present may object to the casting or canvassing or the refusal to cast or canvass any ballot. That section goes on to provide that, when such an objection is made, the board of inspectors shall “proceed to determine such objection and reject or cast [count] such ballot according to such determination.” If the two inspectors agree to sustain the objection, the envelope is not opened and the ballot is not canvassed. However, in the event that the two inspectors agree not to sustain an objection, although an endorsement to that effect must be endorsed on the envelope, the ballot is removed from the envelope and canvassed (counted).
It is with respect to this latter situation that the attorneys for the interested candidates seek relief from this court pursuant to Election Law § 16-112. The candidates’ attorneys argue that if there is no judicial review before a challenged ballot is counted, as a practical matter, there would never be any meaningful judicial review of an objection that the vote was being improperly cast because, once a ballot has been counted, there is no mechanism for specifically linking that ballot to a particular envelope. Therefore, there is no method by which the court, upon determining that a particular envelope was defective, could order that the ballot not be counted. In opposition, the City Board of Elections, relying primarily upon Matter of People for Ferrer v Board of Elections of City of N.Y. (286 AD2d 783 [2d Dept 2001]), argues that this court lacks the authority to vary the statutory procedure set forth in Election Law § 9-209 (2) (d) for the judicial review of ballots challenged by a candidate or his or her representative.
Pursuant to Election Law § 16-112, this court, on such conditions as may be proper, is authorized to direct the examination of any ballot or voting machine on which a candidate’s name appeared, and the preservation of any ballots in view of a prospective contest. As the candidates’ attorneys correctly note, once a challenged ballot is separated from the information submitted by the voter on the envelope and counted, this court’s judicial review pursuant to Election Law § 16-112 is rendered ineffective. Indeed, once the ballot is counted among the others, it is questionable if there could be any meaningful judicial review in the event the court finds that a particular voter was not entitled to cast a ballot. Furthermore, since such defects, if any, would not appear on the face of the ballot, a subsequent re-canvass would be futile (see Matter of Progno v Monroe County Election Commrs., 19 AD2d 462 [1963]; Matter of O’Shaughnessy v Monroe County Bd. of Elections, 15 AD2d 183, 188 [1961]).
Under these circumstances, the court finds it appropriate to take steps to preserve the challenged ballots for an effective judicial review of the board of inspectors’ determination. As stated by the Court in Progno (19 AD2d at 464), “[i]f such is not done and the proposed objections are disallowed by the Board of Inspectors, any judicial review of that determination will be thwarted by the deposit of the ballot in the ballot box.” Thus, the court hereby orders that, if the objections are made and are not sustained by the board of inspectors, the latter shall open each such envelope and make a photocopy of the ballot before canvassing the ballot, then place, the photocopy of the ballot in the envelope, reseal the envelope and endorse on the envelope a notation that the objection was not sustained and that the ballot has been canvassed and a photocopy thereof resealed pursuant to this order.
Contrary to the City Board of Elections’ contention, the Second Department’s decision in People for Ferrer v Board of Elections of City of N.Y. (286 AD2d 783 [2001]) does not dictate a different result here. In that case, four Democratic mayoral candidates, Fernando Ferrer, Mark Green, Alan G. Hevesi and Peter F. Vallone, had asked the court, inter alia, to establish a procedure allowing for expedited judicial review of Board of Elections rulings as to whether a paper ballot should be counted. The key dispute between the four candidates and the Board of Elections was over whether challenges to the board of inspectors’ decisions concerning the counting of a paper ballot could be immediately taken to a judge. The Queens Administrative Judge, Steven W Fisher, appointed a judge to sit at the Board of Elections to immediately rule on individual objections to the board of inspectors’ decision on paper ballots. On appeal, the Appellate Division held that Justice Fisher had no authority to modify the statutory procedure set forth in Election Law § 9-209 (2) (d) for judicial review of challenged ballots, or the authority to vary the Board of Elections’ statutory procedure for the canvassing of affidavit ballots (see Election Law § 8-302 [3] [e] [ii]). Justice Fisher’s order, which provided for an immediate review of challenged ballots, precluded the board of inspectors from rejecting or counting a challenged ballot in the first instance, as set forth in Election Law § 9-209 (2) (d), thus, resulting in a modification of the statute.
Here, however, the remedy fashioned by this court — requiring the Board of Elections, in the event the two members of the board of inspectors agree that a challenged ballot should be counted, to make a copy of the ballot before it is counted and seal it back inside the ballot envelope — effectively preserves the ballot for judicial review, and in no way modifies the statutory procedure for judicial review or impinges upon the board of inspectors’ ability to make a determination and count challenged ballots.
For the reasons stated herein, it is hereby ordered that in the event the board of inspectors does not sustain an objection to a ballot, if made, that the board of inspectors shall open each such envelope and make a photocopy of the ballot before canvassing the ballot, and then place the photocopy of the ballot in the envelope and reseal the envelope and endorse on the envelope a notation that the objection was not sustained and that the ballot has been canvassed pursuant to this order.",0

Eugene E. Peckham, S.
The will of Cecile S. Jones named as coexecutors of her estate, Richard M. Runyon and Nancy A. Clarke, her daughter. Letters testamentary were issued to them on August 6, 2003.
Nancy A. Clarke has submitted to the Clerk of this Court a durable general power of attorney on the New York statutory short form by which she names Richard M. Runyon, her coexecutor, as her attorney-in-fact to carry out “estate transactions.” In an affidavit submitted with the proposed filing, Mr. Runyon states that Ms. Clarke “travels extensively and is frequently unavailable to execute documents” and “the primary purpose of the Power of Attorney is to allow me to conduct my executorial duties without having to physically send documents to my Co-Executrix for execution.”
The power of attorney is requested to be filed pursuant to EPTL 13-2.3, 22 NYCRR 207.48 and section 5-1502G of the General Obligations Law. Those provisions provide rules for recording powers of attorney relating to or affecting “an interest in a decedent’s estate.” The phrase “interest in the estate” refers to that of a beneficiary, not an executor or other fiduciary. (Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 17B, EPTL 13-2.3.) Thus, the section does not apply to the recording of a power of attorney from an executor.
But even more significant, a fiduciary cannot delegate the responsibility for the entire administration of the estate or trust. “[T]he duty of a fiduciary is personal and cannot be divested by delegation.” (41 NY Jur 2d, Decedents’ Estates § 1479, at 84-85.) A fiduciary who does so is liable for breach of trust and potentially subject to surcharge. (Woodbridge v Bockes, 59 App Div 503 [4th Dept 1901]; Matter of Badenhausen, 38 Misc 2d 698 [Sur Ct, Richmond County 1963]; Matter of Ringler & Co., 70 Misc 576 [Sup Ct, NY County 1911]; Restatement [Second] of Trusts § 171, Comment c; 2a Scott on Trusts § 171.1, at 439 [Fratcher 4th ed].) Consequently, a fiduciary is not authorized to give a general power of attorney. The phrase “estate transactions” in the General Obligations Law is limited to transactions by an estate or trust beneficiary, and does not apply to an attempted assignment by a fiduciary of total responsibility for the administration of the estate. In Woodbridge, the trustee gave a power of attorney to the husband of the income beneficiary of the trust to manage the trust. The Court held the trustee was guilty of a breach of trust. A fiduciary cannot delegate the whole responsibility for the administration of the estate, even to a cofiduciary.
If the fiduciary truly does not wish to participate in or be responsible for the administration of the estate, her solution is to petition the court for permission to resign her office. (SCPA 715.)",1
0218-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Nicholas Figueroa, J.
Petitioner, a firefighter, seeks a judgment, pursuant to CPLR article 78, annulling respondents’ determination which denied him prior service credit as a police officer with the Police Department of the City of New York (NYPD) for purposes of computing his seniority and pay grade in his present status as a member of the Fire Department of the City of New York (NYFD). In short, petitioner seeks a retroactive transfer of his NYPD employment, promotion and pension benefits to his new employer, the NYFD.
Respondents cross-move to dismiss the application (CPLR 7804 [f]; 3211 [a] [7]), on the ground that petitioner is barred from receiving NYFD credit for his prior NYPD service, because of a break in petitioner’s employment with the two departments, which prevents his employment with the police being deemed “immediately prior” to his NYFD service as mandated by law (Administrative Code of City of NY § 15-111). Therefore, respondents argue, petitioner fails to state a cause of action, and his application must be denied.
By way of background, petitioner was a police officer from December 8, 1997 until his resignation on April 9, 2002. Prior to the time he resigned from the NYPD, petitioner passed NY-FD ’s written and physical examinations, and submitted all required documentation.
Petitioner alleges that while still a police officer, he received information that his appointment as a firefighter was imminent due to his standing on the civil service list. Petitioner does not identify the source of this intelligence.
After his resignation from NYPD on April 9, 2002, petitioner received a letter dated April 15, 2002 informing him that he was “being offered the opportunity to be appointed a probationary New York City Firefighter.” The letter informed petitioner that he had until April 22, 2002 to accept the appointment.
More significantly, the effective date of petitioner’s NYFD appointment was scheduled for May 5, 2002. However, because of a continuing unspecified investigation by the NYPD, petitioner’s NYFD appointment was delayed until July 28, 2002. Although respondents characterize the investigation as an inquiry “into [petitioner’s] character and dealings,” there is nothing before the court revealing the nature and extent of the investigation. Petitioner was never charged with any disciplinary violation.
During the period from September 27, 2002 to December 20, 2002, petitioner was paid a NYFD salary which mistakenly included credit for his prior NYPD service. However, NYFD subsequently corrected itself by reducing petitioner’s salary after December 20, 2002 and informed him that it would move to recover the excess salary erroneously based on his NYPD prior service.
Petitioner alleges that he is entitled to credit for his prior service under Personnel Rules and Regulations of City of New York (55 RCNY) Appendix A, 1Í 6.2.1. The court finds that the regulation is inapplicable, however, because it applies only to an employee who has resigned or retired from a city agency and is then “reinstated with the approval of the commissioner of citywide administrative services to . . . a position in another agency to which the employee would have been eligible for transfer.” (Id. H 6.2.1 [a] [2].)
Petitioner’s attorney conceded, at oral argument, that this case does not involve a transfer or reinstatement. Even without that concession, it is apparent that petitioner did not transfer from NYPD to NYFD; rather, he resigned from one agency and began work with another. Petitioner fails to disclose the existence of any statute or regulation authorizing a transfer under such circumstances.
Nor does Administrative Code § 15-111 (a) (1) provide a basis for the relief petitioner seeks. That provision specifically limits credit for prior NYPD employment to “[a]ny member of the uniformed source of the fire department, who immediately prior to his or her appointment or employment as such, has served or shall have served as a member of the police force of the police department” (emphasis added).
This code provision is plain and unambiguous. The words “immediately prior” indicate that the provision does not contemplate a break in service. The dictionary definition of immediately (see McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 234) is “without interval of time” (Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1129 [1995]).
Contrary to petitioner’s argument, reliance on the provision’s plain meaning is not inconsistent with logic or fairness. Petitioner, for reasons that remain unarticulated, voluntarily resigned from NYPD prior to his NYFD employment. He was under no apparent compulsion to do so, and cannot ascribe his current status to a defect in the Administrative Code’s wording.
Given the code provision’s plain meaning, there is no need to glean the legislative intent behind section 15-111 (a) (1) of the Administrative Code (see Sega v State of New York, 60 NY2d 183 [1983]). Moreover, even if, as petitioner urges, the court were to consider the provision’s legislative history (see Matter of Sutka v Conners, 73 NY2d 395, 403 [1989]), it would still be unavailing. In 1941, the New York City Council amended then Administrative Code of the City of New York § 487a-10.0 by inserting the word “immediately” before the word “prior.” The precision of the 1941 amendment and its resulting plain meaning preclude a search for the enactment’s intended purpose. The court may not “suppos[e] that the legislature will deliberately place words in a statute without any purpose in view” (Erie County Water Auth. v Kramer, 4 AD2d 545, 550 [1957], affd 5 NY2d 954 [1959]). Such specificity in the positioning of these words demands the utmost deference, notwithstanding their seemingly severe effect. Therefore, the court cannot ignore the City Council’s intent to make “immediately prior” police employment, not simply prior police employment, the prerequisite for crediting NYPD service time toward NYFD benefits.
As a result, petitioner’s resignation must be deemed a break in service denying him entitlement based on prior service (see Matter of Franchina v Codd, 46 NY2d 816 [1978], read on dissent of Lupiano, J., 57 AD2d 394, 400 [1977]; Matter of Doering v Hinrichs, 289 NY 29 [1942]; Winkel v Teachers Retirement Sys. of City of N.Y., 149 NYS2d 443 [1956]).
There is no merit to petitioner’s new argument in his reply papers that in 1989 the respondents had deemed another officer’s service continuous despite his resignation from NYPD. Nor has petitioner demonstrated that the denial of credit for his NYPD service represents a change in NYFD policy. Moreover, petitioner has not demonstrated that the facts and circumstances of the other employee’s case are indistinguishable from petitioner’s (see Matter of Field Delivery Serv. [Roberts], 66 NY2d 516, 518 [1985]). Thus, petitioner has fallen short of demonstrating that respondents have departed from agency precedent in determining his rights (id. at 520).
Lastly, there is no merit to petitioner’s argument that he is entitled to service credit under Retirement and Social Security Law § 645. Petitioner has not applied for pension benefits or service credit under that statute. Such application is necessary to take advantage of the statute. Moreover, the statute applies to persons who left a city or state retirement system and who wish to buy back benefits they received on leaving. Therefore, petitioner may not rely on the statute for the relief he seeks.
Accordingly, the cross motion to dismiss the petition is granted, and the petition is dismissed.",0
0016-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Memorandum.
Appeal from order unanimously dismissed.
Final judgment unanimously reversed without costs, order dated December 2, 1999 vacated, and motion by the New York City Housing Authority to dismiss granted to the extent of dismissing landlord’s cause of action against it.
The appeal from the intermediate order must be dismissed because the right of direct appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of the final judgment (see Matter of Aho, 39 NY2d 241, 248 [1976]). The order is brought up for review on the appeal from the final judgment (see CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).
The final judgment entered against the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) must be reversed, the order denying its motion to dismiss vacated, and the motion granted to the extent of dismissing landlord’s cause of action against it for section 8 subsidy payments allegedly wrongfully withheld. Because NYCHA is not in possession of the property, it is not, as the law now stands, a party respondent against whom a final judgment for possession and/or arrears can be entered in a summary proceeding to recover the possession of property. “[A] summary proceeding, being a possessory remedy, lies only against the tenant in possession and those in possession under the tenant” (Euclid Holding Co. v Schulte, 153 Misc 455, 461 [1934], revd on other grounds 153 Misc 832 [1934]; see Radlog Realty Corp. v Geiger, 254 App Div 352 [1938] [assignor not in possession not a proper party]; Goldstein v 9 Skyline Gym Corp., 2002 NY Slip Op 40376[U] [App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists] [guarantor of lease not a proper party in a summary proceeding]; Greenberg v Khezrie, NYLJ, Feb. 8, 2000, at 28, col 6 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]; Stojanoski v Tonick Enters., NYLJ, Apr. 9, 1996, at 33, col 4 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]). In addition, because NYCHA’s obligation to make rent subsidy payments arises, like that of a guarantor, from an independent contract between it and the owner and because there is no privity of estate or landlord-tenant relationship between it and the owner, the subsidy payments cannot be considered “rent.” “Rent . . . comes only from the land leased, and only out of the relationship of landlord and tenant” (1 Dolan, Rasch’s Landlord and Tenant — Summary Proceedings § 12:1, at 523-524 [4th ed]). Under the law as it now stands, such non-“rent” payments are not recoverable in a summary proceeding (RPAPL 741 [5]; see e.g. Matter of Binghamton Hous. Auth. v Douglas, 217 AD2d 897 [1995]). Accordingly, landlord’s claim against NYCHA for rent subsidy payments is dismissed without prejudice to renewal in a proper forum.
We note that to the extent that the second partial consent decree in Williams v New York City Hous. Auth. (US Dist Ct, SD NY 1995, Ward, J., 81 Civ 1801) requires the joinder of NYCHA “as a necessary party” in certain instances, this may perhaps be interpreted as requiring the joinder of NYCHA as a party so that it have notice of the proceeding and an opportunity to defend the tenant, but it cannot be interpreted to mean that a judgment for arrears can be entered against NYCHA in the summary proceeding (cf. McQueen v Grinker, 158 AD2d 355 [1990] [where direct vendor payments are made by Department of Social Services (DSS) to publicly-subsidized housing programs, joinder of DSS in summary proceeding is appropriate so that the proceeding can be stayed until the agencies can resolve their bookkeeping differences]). Inasmuch as a summary proceeding is a creature of statute (RPAPL art 7), only the Legislature and not the parties can enlarge the jurisdiction of the court so as to allow for the entry of a money judgment against NYCHA (Beach v Nixon, 9 NY 35 [1853]).
In our view, the interests of judicial economy would be better served if, in a summary proceeding, the court were to have the authority to determine claims based upon rent subsidy contracts or rent guarantee contracts together with the rent claims themselves, as this would obviate the need for the multiple litigations to which resort must now be had. Accordingly, we call upon the Legislature to amend the RPAPL to provide the summary proceeding court with ancillary jurisdiction over such claims.

0802-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Thomas A. Standee, J.
The defendants, Burnham Pacific Properties, Inc., BPP Liquidating Trust, Scott C. Verges, and Douglas P Wilson, trustees of the BPP Liquidating Trust (collectively Burnham), submit a motion seeking an order dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and for lack of personal jurisdiction over the parties, or in the alternative, to dismiss or stay this action for forum non conveniens. The plaintiff, DDR Real Estate Services, Inc., opposes this motion and contends that New York is the proper forum.
The defendants have withdrawn their motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction which was asserted based on failure to properly serve.
The motion by the defendants for an order dismissing this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is granted.
I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
The defendants assert that New York courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction over this contract action.
A. Business Corporation Law § 1314 — Actions By Foreign Corporations
In support of their motion to dismiss defendants rely upon Business Corporation Law § 1314. This section sets forth the specific types of actions that may be maintained in a New York court by a foreign corporation against another foreign corporation.
Upon review of the types of cases allowed to be commenced against a foreign corporation by another foreign corporation in New York, this court determines that this action does not fall under any of the specified cases allowed to be commenced in New York (Business Corporation Law § 1314 [b]). There is no subject matter jurisdiction based upon Business Corporation Law § 1314.
Nevertheless, the plaintiff argues that this Business Corporation Law provision is not dispositive of the motion.
B. General Obligations Law §§ 5-1401 and 5-1402 — Choice of Law and Choice of Forum
Plaintiff asserts that jurisdiction is proper because there are choice of law and choice of forum clauses in the parties’ agreement. Plaintiff claims that the provisions in the agreement bring this action under the choice of law and choice of forum statutes in the General Obligations Law and also that public policy favors enforcement of forum selection clauses designating New York courts.
The General Obligations Law sets forth a choice of law statute which allows parties to a contract or agreement, arising out of a transaction covering in the aggregate of not less than $250,000, to agree that New York law shall govern their rights and duties in whole or in part (General Obligations Law § 5-1401 [l]). There is no requirement that the contract or agreement bear any reasonable relation to New York (id.).
The General Obligations Law also sets forth a choice of forum statute (General Obligations Law § 5-1402 [1]). This provision allows any person to maintain an action, notwithstanding Business Corporation Law § 1314 (b), against a foreign corporation or nonresident where the action arises out of a contract or agreement
“for which a choice of New York law has been made in whole or in part pursuant to section 5-1401 and which (a) is a contract, agreement or undertaking ... in consideration of, or relating to any obligation arising out of a transaction covering in the aggregate, not less than one million dollars, and (b) which contains a provision or provisions whereby such foreign corporation or non-resident agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.” (General Obligations Law § 5-1402 [1]).
These statutes implement the public policy that favors New York courts retaining and determining lawsuits where New York law is applicable to the dispute pursuant to the agreement of the parties and New York is the designated forum (see Credit Francois Intl. v Sociedad Financiera de Comercio, 128 Misc 2d 564, 572-573 [Sup Ct, NY County 1985]). The general principle is that if sophisticated businesspeople, after arm’s length negotiations, decide by agreement to apply the laws of New York to any dispute, they will also choose the New York courts as the forum for any litigation. The purpose of the legislation was to ensure that if parties agreed to the laws, courts, and jurisdiction of New York courts, then New York courts would not dismiss the action based on insufficient contact or relationship with New York (see Mem of Legis Representative of City of NY in Support of L 1984, ch 421, 1984 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 3288-3289). As the language of the statutes, the legislative memorandum, and the cases indicate, New York courts are required to permit parties to maintain an action pursuant to a contractual agreement which meets the monetary threshold, agrees to jurisdiction, chooses to apply New York law, and chooses New York courts as the forum for litigation.
The contract at issue between the parties, “Liquidation and Property Management Services Agreement” entered into September 10, 2000, contains a choice of law provision and a choice of forum clause.
“Section 12.10 Applicable Law. This Agreement and all other documents and instruments executed and delivered to evidence, complete, or perfect the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will be interpreted, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws regardless of (a) where any such instrument is executed or delivered; or (b) where any payment or other performance required by any such instrument is made or required to be made; or (c) where any breach of any provision of any such instrument occurs, or any cause of action otherwise accrues; or (d) where any action or other proceeding is instituted or pending; or (e) the citizenship, domicile, principal place of business, or jurisdiction otherwise would apply the laws of jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland-, or (g) any combination of the foregoing.
“Section 12.11 Choice of Forum. Any action to enforce, arising out of, or relating in any way to, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be brought and prosecuted solely and exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the State of New York and the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of said courts and to service of process by registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any other manner provided by law.” (Liquidation Agreement §§ 12.10, 12.11 [emphasis added].)
The choice of law to apply is that of the State of Maryland, with the choice of forum and exclusive jurisdiction being the federal or state courts located in the State of New York.
In order for a choice of forum to be effective under section 5-1402 the statutory requirements are:
(1) there must be an agreement “for which a choice of New York law has been made in whole or in part pursuant to section 5-1401” (General Obligations Law § 5-1402 [1]), and
(2) the agreement must involve an obligation arising out of a transaction covering not less than one million dollars, and
(3) the agreement must contain a clause whereby the foreign corporation or nonresident agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of New York State.
Neither party in this action refutes that the agreement involves an amount over one million dollars. The agreement contains a clause where the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of courts in New York State. There is, however, an issue as to whether the agreement meets the choice of law requirements under section 5-1401.
Under section 5-1401 parties “may agree that the law of this state shall govern their rights and duties in whole or in part, whether or not such contract, agreement or undertaking bears a reasonable relation to this state” (General Obligations Law § 5-1401 [1] [emphasis added]). The liquidation and property management services agreement entered into by the parties contains a choice of law provision to interpret, construe, apply and enforce the contract transaction according to the laws of the State of Maryland. This agreement to apply the laws of the State of Maryland is the only choice of law provision of the parties. There is no specific clause agreeing to apply the laws of New York State.
The plaintiff asserts that there was a choice of law in part because the agreement language at section 12.11 on the choice of federal or state courts located in New York requires the application of New York law for the procedural aspects of service of process. The defendants, however, rely upon legislative history to assert that the purpose of General Obligations Law §§ 5-1401 and 5-1402 was to promote contracts with choice of law provisions deciding on New York law for the substantive issues and also the New York court forum to apply that law. Defendants also argue that the act of simply selecting New York as the forum does not make the choice of New York law contemplated by General Obligations Law § 5-1401.
The defendants’ position is correct. The choice of forum provision set forth here does not state that it is choosing New York procedural law for service of process. Instead the parties agree to the exclusive forum of a federal or state court located in the State of New York, consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of said court, and agree to service of process by registered mail, return receipt requested, “or by any other manner provided by law.” This broad language might require the application of either the laws for service of process under the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules or under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, depending on whether this action was commenced in state or federal court. This is not a specific agreement by the parties that the procedural law of New York State was to govern their service of process.
There is no choice of law provision in the parties’ agreement sufficient to demonstrate that the parties agreed that the law of New York shall govern the parties’ rights and duties in whole or in part sufficient to comply with General Obligations Law § 5-1401 (1). In order for the choice of forum provision under section 5-1402 to apply, there has to be a choice of New York law (General Obligations Law § 5-1402 [1]; see Creative Resources v Rumbellow, 244 AD2d 383 [2d Dept 1997]). This requirement, that the parties’ agreement choose New York law to govern any disputes, is consistent with the public policy purposes of sections 5-1401 and 5-1402. Here, the only choice of law made by the parties involved in this action is to apply the laws of the State of Maryland. The parties did not agree that the law of New York State was their choice of law, either in whole or in part. Further the argument that choosing New York as a forum necessarily implies that the procedural law of New York is chosen is unpersuasive.
The limited circumstances allowed under General Obligations Law §§ 5-1401 and 5-1402 for courts to enforce parties’ agreements containing New York State choice of law and choice of forum clauses do not exist in this action. The plaintiff may not maintain this action under these General Obligations Law provisions.
C. Jurisdiction
The plaintiffs assert that a decision by the Superior Court of California leads to the conclusion that the parties must litigate this dispute in New York. In an action entitled Verges v DDR Real Estate Servs. (Cal Super Ct, Contra Costa County, Case No. C03-00113), there was a motion filed by DDR Real Estate Services, Inc. to stay/dismiss the action because of the mandatory forum selection clause presented here. By a decision of Barbara Zuniga, Judge of the Superior Court, dated March 13, 2003, the motion to stay was granted with statements that “Plaintiffs have sued as BBP’s successors in interest and are bound by forum-selection clause”; “Forum selected was negotiated at arms length”; and that “Case will be set for status review September 15, 2003.”
Although the Superior Court of California granted a motion to stay the California action and determined that the plaintiffs were bound by the forum selection clause, this decision of the California court cannot create subject matter jurisdiction over this pending action in this New York court. The California court appears to recognize this as well because it merely stayed the action and set it for a status review, rather than granting the motion to dismiss the action. The California decision does not create subject matter jurisdiction or require the New York courts to litigate this dispute.
There is no jurisdiction created under Business Corporation Law § 1314 and there is no jurisdiction created under General Obligations Law §§ 5-1401 and 5-1402. Although plaintiff intimates that there may be sufficient contacts to establish long-arm jurisdiction, it has failed to present any evidence from its own client to show any basis for jurisdiction under CPLR 302. Further, there has been no showing by the plaintiff that any discovery is necessary to obtain additional evidence regarding this subject matter jurisdiction issue.
The motion by the defendants for an order dismissing this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is granted.
II. Forum Non Conveniens
The defendants requested alternative relief in the form of an order to dismiss or stay this action for forum non conveniens. Because the defendants are entitled to an order dismissing this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, there is no need to reach the alternative request for relief under the theory of forum non conveniens.
Order
Based upon all the papers submitted in support and in opposition to this motion, upon the above decision, and after due deliberation, it is hereby ordered that the motion of the defendants for an order dismissing this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is granted.
. Business Corporation Law § 1314 (b) states as follows:
“Except as otherwise provided in this article, an action or special proceeding against a foreign corporation may be maintained by another foreign corporation of any type or kind or by a non-resident in the following cases only:
“(1) Where it is brought to recover damages for the breach of a contract made or to be performed within this state, or relating to property situated within this state at the time of the making of the contract.
“(2) Where the subject matter of the litigation is situated within this state.
“(3) Where the cause of action arose within this state, except where the object of the action or special proceeding is to affect the title of real property situated outside this state.
“(4) Where, in any case not included in the preceding subparagraphs, a non-domiciliary would be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of this state under section 302 of the civil practice law and rules.
“(5) Where the defendant is a foreign corporation doing business or authorized to do business in this state.”
. General Obligations Law § 5-1401 (1) states as follows: “l. The parties to any contract, agreement or undertaking, contingent or otherwise, in consideration of, or relating to any obligation arising out of a transaction covering in the aggregate not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, including a transaction otherwise covered by subsection one of section 1-105 of the uniform commercial code, may agree that the law of this state shall govern their rights and duties in whole or in part, whether or not such contract, agreement or undertaking bears a reasonable relation to this state . . . .”
. Whether it is sufficient for obtaining jurisdiction pursuant to General Obligations Law §§ 5-1401 and 5-1402 by the parties contractually agreeing to specifically apply the substantive laws of another state and the procedural laws of New York is not decided here.",0
0579-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Ferris D. Lebous, J.
The defendant State of New York moves to dismiss this claim on the grounds it fails to comply with the statutory pleading requirements of Court of Claims Act § 8-b relative to unjust conviction claims. More specifically, the sole basis of the State’s motion is the contention that a youthful offender adjudication cannot support an unjust conviction claim pursuant to Court of Claims Act § 8-b. Claimant opposes the motion.
A review of the underlying facts is warranted here even though a detailed factual recitation is set forth in the opinion of the State of New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Third Judicial Department. (People v William EE., 276 AD2d 918 [2000].) This claim arises from an incident which occurred on October 9, 1997 in the Village of Montour Falls, Schuyler County, New York. Schuyler County Sheriff Deputies John Pierce and Michael Ruocco responded to a domestic incident call involving claimant and his girlfriend. Upon arriving at the scene, Schuyler County Sheriff Deputies Pierce and Ruocco began questioning the principals, as well as neighbors. Soon thereafter, Deputy Pierce
“requested that [claimant] come from around a fence so that they could talk without distractions. [Claimant] complied. At this time, [claimant] was specifically told that he was not under arrest and that Pierce just ‘wanted to talk to him.’ When [claimant] approached the patrol car, Pierce opened its back door and requested that [claimant] get inside. [Claimant] responded that ‘he wasn’t going to get into the car because [Pierce] had no reason to arrest him.’ Pierce repeated his claim that [claimant] was not going to be arrested, specifically told [claimant] that he had no grounds to arrest him and repeated his desire to simply talk to him in the car. [Claimant] became increasingly upset and began yelling that ‘he didn’t do anything’ and that Pierce did not ‘have any right to arrest him.’ ” (People v William EE., 276 AD2d at 918.)
Soon thereafter the deputies believed claimant was attempting to run so they grabbed his shirt from behind and forced him to the ground. During this physical altercation each deputy injured a finger. As a result, claimant was indicted on two counts of assault in the second degree and resisting arrest. (Penal Law § 120.05 [3]; § 205.30.) At the time of this incident, claimant was 17 years old, born on October 29, 1979.
The facts and timeline relative to the subsequent legal proceedings with respect to this matter are undisputed. After a jury trial, claimant was found guilty on the two assault charges but acquitted on the resisting arrest charge. According to the “sentence & commitment” statement, claimant received consecutive sentences of 90 days on each count. Notably, however, claimant was found to be a youthful offender and his conviction was vacated and replaced by a youthful offender adjudication pursuant to CPL 720.20 et seq. Claimant was incarcerated from March 10, 1999 through April 5, 1999 in the Schuyler County Jail for a total of 27 days.
On October 26, 2000, the Third Department reversed the judgment finding “that there was legally insufficient evidence that defendant intended to prevent a police officer from performing a lawful duty necessary to support his convictions for assault in the second degree.” (People v William EE., 276 AD2d at 919 [citations omitted].) More specifically, the Third Department determined that claimant’s “conduct in doing that which he was legally entitled to do — refusing to get into the patrol car — did not give the Deputies reasonable suspicion to detain him or constitute an intention on his part to interfere with their investigation.” (Id.) The judgment was reversed, on the law, and the indictment dismissed.
This claim was filed with the clerk of the court on October 10, 2002 and served on the Office of the Attorney General on October 15, 2002 by certified mail, return receipt requested. The State filed a verified answer on November 25, 2002 which contained, among other things, two affirmative defenses directed to the insufficiency of the claim under Court of Claims Act § 8-b and the inapplicability of said statute in light of claimant’s youthful offender adjudication.
The State’s position on this motion is that it is legally impossible for claimant to establish that he has been convicted as required by Court of Claims Act § 8-b, because his conviction was vacated and replaced by a youthful offender adjudication pursuant to the CPL.
In opposition, claimant does not deny the apparent incongruity of these statutory provisions, but instead emphasizes that Court of Claims Act § 8-b must be construed to include youthful offenders such as claimant since a conviction is a necessary prerequisite for a youthful offender adjudication. Further, claimant argues that despite his youthful offender adjudication he still suffered the indignities of an unjust conviction inasmuch as he was “[c]harged, tried and convicted in a public trial of a felony offense [and] was incarcerated in an adult facility and subject to the same deprivations, indignities and humiliation as any other prisoner.” (Affirmation of Daniel J. Fitzsimmons, Esq. 1110.)
Discussion
The sole question before this court is whether a youthful adjudication serves as a proper foundation for a cause of action under Court of Claims Act § 8-b. For the reasons that follow, this court finds that it does.
At issue here is the portion of Court of Claims Act § 8-b, the unjust conviction statute, which requires that
“[i]n order to present the claim for unjust conviction and imprisonment, claimant must establish by documentary evidence that:
“(a) he has been convicted of one or more felonies or misdemeanors against the state and subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the sentence ...” (Court of Claims Act § 8-b [3] [a]; emphasis added).
The legislative purpose underlying the passage of Court of Claims Act § 8-b provides compelling guidance for a resolution of the issue before this court by expressly stating as follows:
“[t]he legislature finds and declares that innocent persons who have been wrongly convicted of crimes and subsequently imprisoned have been frustrated in seeking legal redress due to a variety of substantive and technical obstacles in the law and that such persons should have an available avenue of redress over and above the existing tort remedies to seek compensation for damages.” (Court of Claims Act § 8-b [1].)
Such purpose is further expounded upon in the Report of the Law Revision Commission to the Governor on Redress for Innocent Persons Unjustly Convicted and Subsequently Imprisoned (hereinafter Law Revision Report) which clearly stresses the goal of providing a remedy for unjust convictions in recognition of the “deprivation and humiliation that such persons suffer.” (1984 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 2902.)
The State argues these legislative goals of Court of Claims Act § 8-b will not be impeded by excluding unjustly convicted youthful offenders from this statute, because youthful offenders do not suffer in the same manner as unjustly convicted adults due to the various benefits available to youthful offenders, such as vacating and replacing the conviction, as well as a continuing eligibility to hold public office, receive any licenses, and the sealing of related records. (CPL 720.35 [1], [2].)
This court finds unavailing the State’s attempts to minimize the harm suffered by this claimant or any other youthful offender ultimately determined to have been unjustly convicted and subsequently imprisoned. Youthful offender status was created with the specific purpose of saving eligible youths from the lifelong stigma and adverse consequences that necessarily flow from a criminal conviction stemming from — for lack of a better phrase — a youthful indiscretion (People v Cook, 37 NY2d 591, 595 [1975]) and, as such, certain procedures were put in place to achieve this goal. For instance, the youthful offender procedure dictates, among other things, that “[u]pon determining that an eligible youth is a youthful offender, the court must direct that the conviction be deemed vacated and replaced by a youthful offender finding . . .” (CPL 720.20 [3]). While CPL 720.35 (1) expressly provides that “[a] youthful offender adjudication is not a judgment of conviction for a crime or any other offense . . .,” nevertheless, it is well settled that the youthful offender procedure is at its core a criminal process whereby an individual is charged, tried, and convicted as any adult would be under the law, but which provides a court an alternative sentencing option. (People v Michael A.C., 27 NY2d 79, 85 [1970].) In other words, the benefits of a youthful offender adjudication flow to an individual only after being arrested, charged, tried and convicted as any criminal defendant. Here, claimant was charged, tried and convicted in a public trial of a felony offense and incarcerated in an adult facility for 27 days. Although claimant’s conviction was vacated and substituted with adjudication as a youthful offender, any argument that he has not suffered “deprivation and humiliation” must fail in view of the entire underlying criminal process and conviction preceding his eligibility for youthful offender treatment and ultimate adjudication.
Moreover, the court rejects the State’s attempt to describe unjustly convicted adults, as opposed to unjustly convicted youthful offenders, as forever laboring under various legal disabilities caused by such conviction. To the contrary, any legal disabilities caused by a later reversed conviction will ultimately be removed for the adult as well, albeit a significant period of time later as compared to the youthful offender who receives such benefits immediately upon sentencing. In and of itself, however, the immediacy of said benefit of youthful offender adjudication should not extinguish an otherwise viable unjust conviction cause of action for a youthful offender later determined to have been unjustly convicted and subsequently imprisoned, although it may well have some relevance on the issue of damages.
Also, the court notes that deeming the term “conviction” to include a youthful offender under limited circumstances is not a novel concept. For instance, CPL 390.15 (1) (b), relating to mandatory HIV testing in certain cases, provides that “the terms ‘defendant’, ‘conviction’ and ‘sentence’ mean and include, respectively, an ‘eligible youth,’ a ‘youthful offender finding’ and a ‘youthful offender sentence’. . . .” Additionally, CPL 530.12 (5) states that “[u]pon conviction of any crime or violation between spouses, parent and child, or between members of the same family or household, the court may in addition to any other disposition, including a conditional discharge or youthful offender adjudication, enter an order of protection.” CPL 530.12 (5) also states that “[f]or purposes of determining the duration of an order of protection entered pursuant to this subdivision, a conviction shall be deemed to include a conviction that has been replaced by a youthful offender adjudication.”
Moreover, deciding to the contrary would force eligible youths standing convicted of a crime to choose, upon such conviction, between the benefits of a youthful offender adjudication and the potential for a civil monetary recovery under Court of Claims Act § 8-b in the event the conviction were ultimately reversed and the statutory requirements otherwise satisfied. The court will not countenance such a situation particularly in view of the Law Revision Report’s emphasis on the concept of providing a potential remedy for an innocent person who has been unjustly convicted and subsequently imprisoned. In this court’s view, to limit the breadth of the statute by focusing on the use of the word “convicted” without regard to the overall purpose and intent of the statute — a remedy for innocent persons unjustly convicted and subsequently imprisoned — would be contrary to stated legislative goals, encouraging form over substance. In short, the State’s argument, based purely on semantics, is contrary to the stated legislative goals of Court of Claims Act § 8-b.
A brief discussion is warranted regarding the main case upon which the State relies, namely a 1993 Court of Claims decision, Pabon v State of New York (Ct Cl, Mar. 31, 1993, Blinder, J., Claim No. 82806, Motion No. M-44228). In Pabon, Judge Blinder determined that an infant adjudged to be a juvenile delinquent “cannot prove that he was convicted when on its face such Family Court adjudication cannot be considered a conviction.” (Pabon, slip op at 4 [citation omitted].) This court finds Pabon distinguishable from the case at bar. The youthful offender procedure differs in significant ways from the juvenile delinquent process. Most notably, a juvenile delinquent adjudication is not the result of a criminal process, as is the youthful offender procedure, but rather is a proceeding in which the needs and best interests of the infant are balanced in Family Court and in which the Criminal Procedure Law does not apply. (Family Ct Act §§ 302.1, 303.1.) As such, Pabon is not dispositive of the issue before this court.
In view of the foregoing, this court finds that the term “conviction” as used in Court of Claims Act § 8-b means and includes a youthful offender finding. As such, the State’s motion to dismiss, Motion No. M-66924, is denied.
. Claimant was also sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay restitution if the victim submitted a claim for out-of-pocket expenses.
. The claim originally asserted two causes of action, namely unjust conviction and unlawful imprisonment, but the parties have since entered into a stipulation whereby the claim was limited solely to an unjust conviction cause of action.",1

Memorandum.
Appeal unanimously dismissed.
No appeal lies by a defaulting party from a judgment entered upon default (CPLR 5511). While we recognize that this rule is subject to exception, e.g., where there has been a formal order determining matters which were the subject of contest in the court below (see Central Savannah Riv. Area Resource Dev. Agency v White Eagle Intl., 110 AD2d 742 [1985]), no such exception applies in the case at bar. We note, however, that the issues raised upon the appeal appear in any event to be without merit.
Plaintiff, a resident of Oregon, claims that he purchased an item from defendant using the on-line auction site eBay, that he paid for the item and that defendant never shipped the item to him. Plaintiff requested and was denied permission to appear for trial of this action by telephone.
UJCA 1804 provides that while small claims procedure is to be informal and simplified, “The court shall conduct hearings upon small claims in such manner as to do substantial justice between the parties according to the rules of substantive law . . . .” This mandate includes substantive due process rights, which may be difficult or impossible to vindicate where remote testimony, particularly by telephone, is permitted. Telephone testimony cannot be said to be of merely procedural concern. For example, the parties to a small claims proceeding have a constitutional right to cross-examination, which in turn is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of testimony is tested” (Graves v American Express, 175 Misc 2d 285, 286 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 1997]). Credibility determinations, largely based upon witness demeanor, are a vital function of the trier of fact (see e.g. Williams v Roper, 269 AD2d 125 [2000]). Testimony by telephone prevents effective evaluation of demeanor as well as effective cross-examination simply because the witness cannot be seen.
Furthermore, plaintiff is the master of his case, and he selected the New York small claims forum in which to prosecute this action. Having done so, he has consented to adjudication of bis claim in accordance with the rules of his chosen forum. The rules governing small claims court contemplate the accomplishment of substantial justice between the parties (UJCA 1804), and for the reasons set forth above, substantial justice in the context of this case cannot be accomplished over the telephone. While frameworks to facilitate remote testimony have been promulgated (see e.g. Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 43 [a]), the technological and, logistical difficulties of doing so in a manner suitable for small claims courts would be best resolved by the Legislature.

0226-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
John Cataldo, J.
Defendant’s motion for inspection of the grand jury minutes is granted, upon consent of the People, who have submitted them for in camera review. Following the inspection, the presentation is found to be legally sufficient.
In this case, unlike the standard grand jury presentation, the charges against the defendant were joined with those of approximately 30 defendants. Accordingly, in light of the unusual nature of this presentation, a detailed CPL 210.35 (5) analysis follows.
The defendant’s case was a part of a presentation labeled by the People as “Operation Good Neighbor.” The presentation began on February 27, 2003, with testimony by one of the detectives involved in the operation. The detective gave the grand jurors an overview of the investigation by describing the nature and scope of “Operation Good Neighbor.” The detective stated the operation was an investigation of narcotics activities in two housing projects in the South Bronx. It involved six or seven undercover officers and approximately 10 investigators. The undercover officers had made narcotics purchases over the preceding five months. At the time of the presentation, no arrests had been made.
The detective described the processes of a long-term investigation. He noted that undercover officers may make multiple buys from an individual while seeking introduction to other dealers. The detective delineated the various roles: steerer, hand-to-hand, money man, stash man, lookout and manager. The detective further informed the grand jury that a person might assume more than one role. The detective testified how the sellers’ identities were established during the course of the investigation. Finally, the grand jury was informed that defendants would be arrested in “takedowns.”
After the detective’s testimony, the cases in Operation Good Neighbor were presented to the grand jury in groups ranging from one to five defendants. The undercovers involved in the operation testified before the Term III Grand Jury on February 27th, March 5th, March 11th, March 13th, March 14th, March 19th and March 21st of 2003. During the sessions, the People distributed exhibit A to the grand jurors as an aid to the presentation. Exhibit A listed the individuals from whom controlled substances had been purchased during the operation. Often, during a session, an undercover (UC) would testify about purchases made from unrelated defendants. However, indictments were filed separately against each defendant. Thus, these were “dual slip” or what one might call “multiple slip” presentations.
The issue is whether the entire proceeding, joining more than 30 defendants and offering up to five cases for a vote at one time, impaired the integrity of the proceedings. (See, People v Adessa, 89 NY2d 677 [1997]; People v Kennedy, 272 AD2d 627 [2d Dept 2000]; People v Litzenberger, 234 AD2d 947 [4th Dept 1996].)
I noted in interim decisions issued on Operation Good Neighbor cases that in People v Raynor (154 Misc 2d 576 [Orange County Ct 1992]), the trial court had dismissed an indictment in which the evidence against codefendants was presented along with that of an unrelated third defendant. A separate indictment was filed against the third defendant. The link between defendants was that each had sold narcotics to the same undercover officer, although at different dates, times and places. The court noted the People’s justification for the dual presentation was the need to expedite cases and effectively utilize the time of the grand jury. It expressed concern that under the People’s theory, an unlimited number of cases against unrelated defendants could be presented to a grand jury, and in effect unfairly bolster the credibility of the witnesses. The court, in dismissing the indictment, perceived a potential for prejudice based solely on the dual presentation.
Upon my review of the statutory and case law, I conclude that the procedure used in this case does not call for automatic dismissal of the indictment. Rather, it requires a particularized inquiry to determine if a specific defendant was potentially prejudiced. Only then would dismissal be mandated.
I begin my analysis by noting that unlike joinder of multiple defendants in one indictment, there is no direct statutory authority relating to the joining of unrelated defendants in one presentation.
Criminal Procedure Law § 200.40 specifies that charges involving separate defendants may not be joined in one indict- . ment for trial except in four enumerated situations. Absent one of these circumstances, upon motion by the defendant, the cases must be severed for trial. If defendants are improperly joined or consolidated for trial, and prejudice is shown, reversal of the conviction is required. (See, People v Valle, 70 AD2d 544 [1st Dept 1979]; People v Potter, 52 AD2d 544 [1st Dept 1976]; People v Spencer, 67 AD2d 867 [1st Dept 1979]; People v Banks, 45 AD2d 1024 [2d Dept 1974]; cf., People v Lopez, 59 AD2d 767 [2d Dept 1977] [disagreed with by Valle, supra].)
It is well established that a defendant may not be jointly tried with a codefendant when the codefendant is charged with additional unrelated sales of drugs. (See, People v Potter, supra; People v Spencer, supra; People v Banks, supra.) Narcotics activities which involve only a codefendant, or a codefendant acting with additional persons, are not related charges since they are not part of the same criminal transaction, scheme or plan, unless there is evidence of a conspiracy. Thus, such crimes fail to come within any of the exceptions for joinder listed in CPL 200.40 (1).
The cases relating to misjoinder of counts against a single defendant are instructive. CPL 200.20 sets forth the circumstances under which multiple criminal acts against a single defendant may be joined in one indictment. A misjoinder under subdivision (2), upon defendant’s motion, will result in severance of the counts.
Appellate courts have repeatedly held that if offenses are properly joinable under CPL 200.20, a prosecutor is entitled to present them to a single grand jury. (See, People v Colon, 306 AD2d 213 [1st Dept 2003]; People v Hemmings, 264 AD2d 529 [2d Dept 1999], lv denied 94 NY2d 863 [1999] [not improper for the People to present evidence relating to two sets of sexual abuse charges to a single grand jury panel where crimes are joinable]; People v Edwards, 240 AD2d 427 [2d Dept 1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 904 [1997] [crimes presented were joinable pursuant to CPL 200.20 (2) (b) and, thus, could properly be presented to one grand jury]; see also, Matter of Hynes v Tomei, 238 AD2d 591 [2d Dept 1997]; People v Simon, 187 AD2d 740 [2d Dept 1992], lv denied 81 NY2d 893 [1993]; Matter of Gold v Booth, 79 AD2d 1013 [2d Dept 1981].)
I note that despite the limitations on joinder listed in CPL 200.40 (1) and 200.20 (2), more latitude to present charges exists within the grand jury presentations. (See, People v Adessa, 89 NY2d 677 [1997]; People v Litzenberger, 234 AD2d 947 [4th Dept 1996]; People v Kennedy, 272 AD2d 627 [2d Dept 2000], infra.)
It has been said that the People retain wide discretion in presenting evidence to the grand jury. (See, People v Huston, 88 NY2d 400, 406 [1996]; People v Mitchell, 82 NY2d 509, 515 [1993]; People v Lancaster, 69 NY2d 20, 25 [1986].)
“Because Grand Jury proceedings are conducted by the prosecutor alone, this function confers upon the prosecutor broad powers and duties, as well as wide discretion in presenting the People’s case. In addition to providing legal instruction to the Grand Jury, the District Attorney determines what evidence to present to that body and what evidence should be excluded.” (Huston, supra at 406 [citations omitted].) Although, this discretion is not without limits. (Id.) Consequently, dismissal of an indictment for impairment of the integrity of a grand jury presentation is an extraordinary remedy which requires a very high and precise standard. Dismissal is only warranted when a defect creates a possibility of prejudice, though actual prejudice is not required to be shown. (Id. at 409.) The likelihood of prejudice turns on the particular facts of each presentation, including the weight and nature of the admissible proof and the degree of inappropriate prosecutorial influence or bias. (Id.)
When defendants are improperly joined in one indictment, a severance would ensure a fair trial. However, the law calls for a further analysis concerning the integrity of the grand jury proceeding itself. Dismissal of the indictment is required if the reviewing court finds the joint presentation created the potential for prejudice which impaired the integrity of the proceedings. See discussion of People v Litzenberger (234 AD2d 947 [1996]) and People v Kennedy (272 AD2d 627 [2000], infra). In that circumstance, dismissal, with leave to re-present, would be the appropriate remedy.
In People v Adessa (89 NY2d 677 [1997], supra), the Court of Appeals addressed the novel question of the propriety of a “dual slip” presentation. The grand jury considered cross accusations against a police officer and civilian. The People sought an indictment against the defendant for reckless endangerment, menacing and other offenses. The grand jury was also charged with investigating the police officer’s shooting of the defendant. The Adessa court framed the issue as one of potential prejudice against a civilian by a grand jury that was jointly considering police misconduct and the charges against the civilian. The Court found it was not inherently prejudicial and did not dismiss the indictment against the citizen defendant.
The facts in Adessa were, in substance, that police officers patrolling in an unmarked car observed the defendant’s vehicle speeding out of a gas station, hitting another car, and nearly striking a security guard. The officers gave chase and eventually the defendant exited his car with a baseball bat and moved in the officers’ direction. One officer fired his gun and defendant was hit in the legs and buttocks. Defendant fled and was eventually arrested by other officers at a hospital.
The Court stated that “[a]bsent a breach of a statutory command or some indication of likely prejudice, there is no legal basis for interfering with the prosecutor’s prerogatives in determining the manner in which a Grand Jury presentment is made.” (Id. at 682.) Although the Court did not find a likelihood of prejudice, it went on to state:
“We stress that our holding in this case should not be construed as a blanket approval of the practice of submitting criminal charges against citizens and cross complaints against police officers to the same Grand. Juries. We recognize that there may be situations in which such a practice could undermine the fairness of the proceeding and lead to palpable prejudice for the accused.” (Id. at 684.)
While the Adessa court rejected defendant’s enumerated claims of prejudice, it reiterated that CPL 210.35 (5) does not require a showing of actual prejudice. Instead, “there must be an articulable ‘likelihood of or at least ‘potential for’ prejudice (see, People v Huston, supra, at 409).” (Id. at 686.)
As previously noted, this presentation involved some defendants whose cases were unrelated. Their commonality was the allegation that the defendants sold cocaine, crack, heroin or other controlled substances to undercover officers who were involved in a long-term operation in two housing projects.
In People v Litzenberger (234 AD2d 947 [1996], supra) and People v Kennedy (272 AD2d 627 [2000], supra), the Courts addressed the issue of when a CPL 210.35 (5) dismissal would be appropriate for joinder of unrelated defendants during a single grand jury presentation.
In Litzenberger, the defendant was indicted for rape and sodomy in a grand jury presentation in which another defendant was charged with having separately committed crimes against the same child victim. The Court noted that the joinder of the both in one indictment had been improper, but found severance of the cases for trial had cured that error. As to defendant’s claim of impairment of the grand jury proceeding itself, the Court held the joinder had not met the very precise and high test for dismissal for impaired integrity. The Court pointed out that the evidence against each defendant in the grand jury presentation was neither insufficient nor disproportionate, and that the grand jury had been properly instructed to treat the evidence against each defendant separately.
In People v Kennedy (272 AD2d 627 [2000], supra), the Court reversed a trial court dismissal of an indictment for misjoinder of defendants. In Kennedy, the defendants, two correction officers, were charged with assaulting an inmate at a correctional facility. At the same presentation, evidence of a distinct assault against the inmate on the same day by different correction officers was presented for indictment. The Second Department found the defendants had failed to demonstrate potential prejudice to the ultimate decision reached by the grand jury. The Court noted that the evidence as to each incident was not so intertwined as to confuse the grand jurors. Additionally, the Court pointed out that the evidence against the defendants was neither insufficient nor disproportionate to that presented against the other officers involved in the separate assault. Moreover, the grand jurors had been instructed to consider the evidence separately against the officers involved.
These cases set forth some of the factors that should be considered when reviewing a presentation of unrelated defendants’ cases to a single grand jury. It is evident that in the circumstances of this presentation, each case must be separately examined for potential prejudice.
Another question presented is whether the potential for prejudice should be evaluated in respect to all of the cases presented or should each session be evaluated in isolation? Since the People have linked all of the cases in one presentation, they must all be reviewed under the prejudice analysis. The greatest possibility for prejudice might occur during the testimony of the undercover who testifies against this specific defendant as well as against other defendants whose cases were presented for a vote at the end of that undercover’s testimony. This is when the potential for confusion, disproportionate proof, or bolstering of credibility is at its greatest.
The People argue that the manner of this presentation avoided time-consuming and repetitive testimony. While the People are likely correct that some time was saved by this proceeding, if potential prejudice resulted, expediency will not justify the system used.
That these 30 or so individuals were alleged to have sold drugs of various kinds over a period of five months in two public housing projects does not make them related in law. Related means acting in concert or engaging in sales as part of a conspiracy, not merely committing similar crimes over a period of time in one neighborhood. I reject the People’s justification that all these cases are related. The People’s argument might lead to shortsighted presentations which create the potential for prejudice.
On the other hand, it would be a mere pronouncement, neither logical nor legally correct, to say that the number of presentations in Operation Good Neighbor, or the number testified to in any one session, constitute by themselves potential prejudice. Rather, one is to look to the testimony of witnesses, the instructions provided to the grand jury and the participation through questions by the grand jury. Only in this manner, it can be determined if there was a likelihood of prejudice by either the sheer number of cases presented or the manner in which they were presented.
In this presentation, the grand jury was repeatedly told that only testimony was evidence. Further, they were told that some exhibits provided were not evidence and were not to be relied upon. Those exhibits were a guide only to the charges presented and persons against whom they were presented. They did not constitute evidence. The exhibits were a menu of items, not a comment on substantive issues.
The grand jury was also told about the various roles played by drug sellers, e.g., hand-to-hand, stash man, manager, etc. However, they were also advised that a person might operate individually. Thus, while the opening presentation was wide-ranging, it was balanced by a caution that not all cases being presented involved these individual roles and participants. Distinctions were made and cautions were given to guide the grand jury during its deliberations.
The grand jury was educated about other matters. In the opening of the presentation, the distinction between a long-term operation and buy and bust operation was noted. The reasons for employing one method over another in a particular situation were explained. The grand jurors were told that in some cases complaints about drug activity came from the community. The notice served to make a distinction between some citizens of the community and others who were alleged to have engaged in narcotics activity. In other words, no individual or community was painted with the broad brush-stroke of illegality. (See, People v Martinez, 179 AD2d 501 [1st Dept 1992], lv denied 79 NY2d 1051 [1992].) The grand jurors were told about the assignment of John Doe names and methods subsequently used to establish true identity. It was explained that the arrest or “takedown” process was accomplished in two stages. The instructions and background information provided a framework within which testimony could be analyzed objectively. It prevented speculation and conjecture by the grand jury.
The grand jurors were reminded on more than one occasion that this information could be explained again if they needed it to assist in deliberations. Jurors were also given numerous opportunities to ask questions of a witness or to inquire into the methods of investigations. Further, my review of the testimony of each witness disclosed no instances of generalizations, over-broad characterizations or an invitation to the grand jury to engage in speculation.
The response by the grand jury to the testimony and the instructions, and any question it posed, could provide evidence of the likelihood of prejudice. There is nothing in their inquiries or responses which demonstrated confusion, speculation or anything else which could give rise to potential bias.
Having now reviewed Mr. Williams’ case for potential prejudice, I find the manner of the presentation did not impair the integrity of the proceedings as to the charges presented against this defendant.
The case of this defendant, Sandy Williams, was presented at two different sessions before the grand jury on March 5, 2003. At the first session, defendant’s case was presented for a vote along with that of two other defendants. At the second session, defendant’s case was presented for vote along with that of four other defendants.
Mr. Williams is charged in a nine-count indictment with five sales of cocaine, four of them near school grounds. During the first of the two sessions on March 5, 2003, evidence as to counts one, two and three, involving two sales, was presented against the defendant. Both sales involved cocaine sold to UC No. 4996 on November 22nd and November 27th. During the sale of November 27, 2002, the undercover stated he called and arranged to meet JD “A” but this defendant was at the location when he arrived. The defendant was asked where’s “A” and replied “He had something to do, what do you need?” After the sales involving Mr. Williams, the undercover testified as to five sales by JD “A.” This defendant was not involved in any of these sales which occurred on different dates and locations from defendant’s offenses. In four of the sales, JD “A” acted alone, in one he acted with another JD (as to whom no charges were presented for vote). Thereafter, the undercover testified as to five sales by JD “B,” in which he acted alone on each occasion, and which had no relationship to either this defendant or JD “A.”
I note that the testimony by the undercover as to the whereabouts of JD “A” did not give rise to potential prejudice as it explained the undercover’s conduct in arriving at the scene. However, the joinder with the five separate sales by JD “A” and the five sales by JD “B” must be further examined.
During the second session of Operation Good Neighbor cases on March 5, 2003, evidence as to the conduct underlying counts four through nine was presented. The defendant’s case was presented along with those of four other defendants and one additional individual against whom charges were not presented. The undercover, No. 4371, testified regarding sales by the defendant on January 18, 2003, January 21, 2003, and January 24, 2003. UC No. 4371 mentioned he had purchased drugs from Mr. Williams before January 18th, but no details of uncharged narcotic activity were elicited. On January 18th, the defendant acted alone. On January 21st, it was alleged he acted with defendant JD “C.” On January 23rd, a purchase was made from JD “C” alone. Mr. Williams’ presence was noted but there was no testimony about criminal activity. JD “C” and UC No. 4371 went inside a store where a.sale occurred. The defendant was not involved in this sale. On January 24th, the undercover purchased cocaine from the defendant and JD “C.” Additional charges were sought as to the other defendants. In all the testimony about 13 sales were presented, 3 of which involved the defendant.
As can be seen, the two sessions of the presentation on March 5th involved nine individuals, including the defendant, and a total of 24 sales to the undercovers, 5 of which involved this defendant. At both sessions, the People handed out exhibit A which lists all alleged sales in the operation as a tool.
Prior to the March 5th presentations, the only other Operation Good Neighbor cases presented were on February 27, 2003. At that time charges against two other defendants were voted.
In this case, since the defendant sometimes acted alone, at other times acted with JD “C,” and in one case arrived in place of JD “A,” the testimony concerning roles given at the commencement of the presentation was appropriate.
Further, evidence as to each count against this defendant was not merely legally sufficient but was well developed and plainly set forth before the grand jury. His activities were not so intertwined with the other defendants to cause grand juror confusion as to the activities which related to him. His involvement in each count was clear, either when he acted alone or when he acted with JD “C.” This was not a case where his behavior was equivocal. When he acted with JD “C” in two of the sales, he was either involved in the negotiations or the transfer of the narcotics. Thus, the evidence was not disproportionate. Additionally, I note that the Assistant District Attorneys and the witnesses never made any “safe street” type arguments or statements and never referred to the defendant as being part of a narcotics organization.
Accordingly, upon a review of the evidence against this defendant and the manner in which his case was combined with both related defendants and unrelated defendants, I conclude that the grand jury presentation did not impair the integrity of the proceedings and did not rise to the level of potential prejudice. Defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment is denied.
I remind the People that use of this method of joinder could imperil future indictments if not properly administered. Additionally, as the legal instructors of the grand jurors, the prosecutor should be scrupulous and even repetitive in giving the grand jury proper limiting instructions and guidance so it can properly evaluate the evidence as to each defendant. The grand jurors should be reminded at each session to consider the evidence separately as to each defendant.
As to defendant’s further motions in his omnibus papers, I rule as follows:
Although the People served identification notice pursuant to CPL 710.30, they contend the identification procedures, both by photographs and on the street, were “confirmatory.” An inquiry, including a hearing if necessary, is ordered to determine whether the identification was confirmatory. (.People v Wharton, 74 NY2d 921 [1989].) If it is found not to have been confirmatory, a Wade hearing is ordered.
Defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars and discovery is granted to the extent of the information provided by the People in the answering affirmation. The People refer to information provided in their voluntary disclosure form (VDF); however, the court file does not contain a VDF. The People are ordered to file a VDF with the court. The People are to turn over to defendant copies of all field tests, laboratory reports, and related vouchers, and as well any photographs which they intend to introduce at trial, if they have not yet supplied these materials to the defense. Defense counsel may reargue the need for any specific item not provided by the People.
Defendant’s motion for a Sandoval/Ventimiglia hearing is referred to the trial court.
Decision on defendant’s request that he be permitted to make any and further motions as may be necessary based on information and disclosure which may result from the granting of requests made in defendant’s motion is reserved until such time as defendant actually seeks to make such a motion.
. Exhibit A is a six-page document which lists the dates of each incident, the time, the John Doe name given to the person involved, the actual names (where known), the undercover officer’s number involved in the purchase, the location of the purchase, and the type of drug involved. There are approximately 190 sales listed, although some are likely duplicates where more than one defendant was involved in a sale. Approximately 60 John Doe (JD) names and 32 actual names are set forth. This exhibit is not attached to this decision as some of the individuals may not as yet have been arrested; however, it is incorporated herein by reference. In addition to exhibit A, a second exhibit is given out as an aid at each individual session. This exhibit was specific to the charges being voted at that session.. It listed the John Doe names, the actual names and the dates relating to each charge upon which an indictment was sought. The grand jurors were reminded that these exhibits were not evidence.
. However, there might occur a situation where multiple presentations give rise to a general potential prejudice and prevent a grand jury from properly deliberating on legal sufficiency and reasonable cause. In this presentation, where at most five defendants’ cases were voted at one time, I do not find the indictments should be dismissed per se. Nevertheless, there may be certain crimes or situations in which the manner in which particular crimes are committed, such that single presentations against different defendants become per se prejudicial, e.g., unrelated home invasions or acts of terrorism, etc.
. CPL 200.40 (1) states: “Two or more defendants may be jointly charged in a single indictment provided that: (a) all such defendants are jointly charged with every offense alleged therein; or (b) all the offenses charged are based upon a common scheme or plan; or (c) all the offenses charged are based upon the same criminal transaction as that term is defined in subdivision two of section 40.10; or (d) if the indictment includes a count charging enterprise corruption . . . .” For further discussion of what constitutes a single criminal transaction or a common scheme or plan see, e.g., People v Kaatsiz (156 Misc 2d 898 [Sup Ct, Kings County 1992]).
. This instruction was important because the exhibit listed some crimes which were not presented to this grand jury. Additional Operation Good Neighbor cases were presented at the next term of the grand jury, and some may remain outstanding.
. The JD names in this decision have all been changed as this court is not aware of which defendants have been arrested and which defendants remain at liberty.",0

Memorandum.
Order and final judgment affirmed without costs.
In settlement of a commercial nonpayment proceeding brought to recover arrears in excess of $33,000, the parties, on January 3, 2001, stipulated that they would execute a renewal agreement as set forth in a proposal which the attorney for the landlord, Greene & Kamen, a copartnership, had sent to the attorney for the tenant, I.O.M., Inc., on December 19, 2000, with specified changes; that landlord would supply the proposed renewal agreement shortly after the date of the stipulation, and that, assuming landlord represented that it was willing to sign the agreement, an agreed settlement amount of $25,000 would be mailed by tenant to landlord within two business days thereafter. On January 4, 2001, landlord’s attorney sent tenant’s attorney the proposed renewal agreement together with the required representation of landlord’s willingness to sign it, but tenant’s principals refused to sign the agreement, claiming that they now realized that the proposed renewal agreement, like the document sent to tenant’s attorney on December 19, 2000, contained a waiver-of-counterclaims clause not found in the original lease. Instead of signing the renewal agreement as it was, tenant’s principals crossed out the waiver-of-counterclaims clause, signed the lease, and sent it back on January 11, 2001 but did not pay the $25,000. For its part, landlord refused to sign the renewal agreement without the clause in question. In the subject plenary action, landlord seeks to recover the principal sum of $25,000 based on tenant’s breach of the stipulation. Tenant seeks to avoid the stipulation on the ground that its officers did not realize, when they agreed to enter into the stipulation, that the waiver-of-counterclaims clause was not found in the original lease. Tenant also argues, inter alia, that, under the original lease, it is entitled to a renewal lease on the same terms and conditions as the original lease.
In our view, the Civil Court, in the plenary action, properly found that tenant had waived its right to a renewal lease under the renewal provision of the original lease and properly awarded summary judgment to landlord, whose performance under the stipulation was complete, on its cause of action to enforce the stipulation. Under the original lease, tenant was entitled to a renewal lease on the same terms and conditions as the original lease only if it was not in default on its obligations thereunder. It is clear that tenant was in default on its obligations and that the agreed-to $25,000 in arrears remained unpaid. In any event, the Civil Court also properly determined that the terms of the stipulation superseded the renewal provision of the original lease. Since tenant did not seek to set aside the stipulation, it was bound by its terms. Moreover, even if tenant had sought to set it aside, its unilateral mistake of fact would be an insufficient predicate upon which to grant such relief since tenant did not show that enforcement of the stipulation would be unconscionable or that it exercised ordinary care in reviewing the December 19th proposed renewal agreement before entering into the stipulation (McClain Realty v Rivers, 144 AD2d 216, 218 [1988]). Notably, the renewal agreement was less than three pages long and contained only eight paragraphs, one of which expressly modified the lease by adding the waiver-of-counterclaims clause.
After the expiration of the original lease on June 30, 2001, landlord commenced the subject holdover proceeding, the appeal in which has been consolidated with the appeal in the plenary action to enforce the stipulation. Tenant’s defense is that, on January 11, 2001, it timely executed the renewal agreement, which landlord wrongly refused to sign. After trial, the Civil Court found, inter alia, that no renewal lease exists and that tenant was collaterally estopped from challenging the earlier Civil Court determination that it had waived its right to insist that the waiver-of-counterclaims clause be removed from the lease.
We agree that no renewal lease came into existence. As noted above, tenant did not have a right, under the renewal provision of the original lease, to a renewal lease because it was in default of its obligations thereunder, and, in any event, the lease renewal provision was superseded by the stipulation. Moreover, the Civil Court correctly determined that tenant was barred, by the finding of waiver in the plenary action, from asserting its right to a renewal lease without a waiver-of-counterclaims provision. In addition, the Civil Court properly held that tenant’s belated offer at trial, held November 1, 2001, to sign the renewal lease containing the waiver-of-counterclaims clause and to pay the $25,000, due under the stipulation in early January 2001, which offer was not accompanied by a tender of the $25,000, was not made within a reasonable time (State of New York v Atlantic Audio-Visual Corp., 118 AD2d 998 [1986]). Finally, tenant did not, under the circumstances presented, establish a sufficient basis for equitable relief from the forfeiture (J.N.A. Realty Corp. v Cross Bay Chelsea, 42 NY2d 392 [1977]) since its default in signing the renewal lease was neither inadvertent nor timely cured.

Thomas A. Standee, J.
Petitioner, Gordon E. Fresher, Jr., has moved by order to show cause for an order granting the following relief: (1) requiring ORMEC Systems Corp. (OSC) to permit petitioner and/or designated agents to inspect and make extracts from the records of shareholders of OSC pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 624; (2) an order of injunction prohibiting respondent Krasnicki from acquiring and/or offering to acquire shares of common stock of ORMEC from shareholders without first complying with the requirements of Business Corporation Law article 16, the Security Takeover Disclosure Act; and (3) requiring respondent Krasnicki to pay petitioner’s attorneys’ fees in connection with this petition.
The order to show cause also contained a temporary restraining order prohibiting OSC from issuing treasury stock to respondent Krasnicki.
Facts
Petitioner is the former CEO and president of OSC. Petitioner was removed from the offices of CEO and chairman of the board by the Board of Directors of OSC in March 2001. By September of 2002, petitioner resigned his director’s position on the board.
Petitioner alleges that there was “considerable friction” between himself and the board for at least a year prior to his termination. On or about May 2002, petitioner allegedly threatened litigation against OSC. A settlement agreement and release were negotiated by petitioner and OSC, addressing the issues arising out of petitioner’s employment.
In October of 2002, respondent Krasnicki joined OSC as president and CEO, and he was also elected to the board at that time. When respondent Krasnicki joined OSC, the board expressed a desire to hire someone with the required demonstrated performance background, as well as an individual who would be willing to invest in OSC in a significant way.
At a December 10, 2002 shareholders’ meeting, the owners of a majority of the shares voted to authorize Krasnicki’s right to purchase 20% of OSC’s stock from the corporation or from OSC shareholders at the price of $1.10, the stock price determined by the board. On March 31, 2003, Krasnicki purchased 372,576 shares of OSC stock directly from the corporation, representing 20% of the outstanding shares of OSC stock.
On December 4, 2002, petitioner issued a request to view OSC’s current shareholder list. That list was thereafter furnished to petitioner, upon petitioner’s execution of a statement, pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 624, stating that he would only use the information in the best interests of OSC.
On February 18, 2003, Krasnicki sent a letter to OSC’s shareholders, outlining the terms of his purchase of OSC’s stock. Shortly thereafter, petitioner sent a letter to OSC’s shareholders, indicating that he was aware of a bid from an outside party for the purchase of OSC’s shares.
Beginning in March 2003, petitioner again requested OSC’s list of shareholders on three separate occasions: March 20, 2003, March 27, 2003, and April 9, 2003. Petitioner’s requests were denied by OSC, which alleged that petitioner had been in contact with a competitor, was aware of a bid for the purchase of OSC’s stock, and that petitioner used that information contrary to OSC’s best interests.
Decision
Applicability of Business Corporation Law Article 16
Article 16 of the Business Corporation Law, entitled the “Security Takeover Disclosure Act,” governs takeover bids of domestic corporations. Section 1601 (a) of the Business Corporation Law defines “takeover bids” as follows:
“(a) ‘Takeover bids’ means the acquisition of or offer to acquire by an offeror from an offeree, pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, any equity security of a target company, if after acquisition thereof the offeror would, directly or indirectly, be a beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of the issued and outstanding equity securities of a target company.” (Business Corporation Law § 1601 [a].)
Black’s Law Dictionary also provides a definition of “Takeover bid”:
“An attempt by an outside corporation or group, usually called the aggressor or ‘insurgent,’ to wrest control away from incumbent management of target corporation. A takeover bid may involve purchase of shares, a tender offer, a sale of assets or a proposal that the target merge voluntarily into the aggressor.” (Black’s Law Dictionary 1454 [6th ed 1990].)
Petitioner argues that the transaction at issue herein is governed by article 16, despite the fact that respondents allege that the purchase of shares was authorized by Business Corporation Law § 505 (d). Section 505 (d) states:
“The issue of such rights or options to one or more directors, officers, or employees of the corporation ... as an incentive to service or continued service with the corporation . . . shall be authorized . . . by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders entitled to vote thereon . . . .” (Business Corporation Law § 505 [d].)
Petitioner alleges that although section 505 (d) of the Business Corporation Law authorizes directors and officers to purchase shares of treasury stock, it does not exempt the transaction from the provision of article 16 of the Business Corporation Law. Petitioner alleges that article 16 is broad in scope and does not exclude acquisitions of stock authorized elsewhere in the Business Corporation Law.
Despite petitioner’s contentions, it is this court’s determination that Business Corporation Law § 505 (d) does not require compliance with Business Corporation Law article 16. The evidence before this court reveals that respondent Krasnicki’s purchase of the subject shares arose from his employment relationship with OSC, and not as a result of a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders. Petitioner provides no authority to the contrary.
Respondent Krasnicki joined OSC as president and CEO in October 2002. On December 10, 2002, 80% of the shares of OSC’s then outstanding stock were voted to authorize Krasnicki to purchase 20% of OSC’s stock either directly from the corporation or from OSC’s shareholders. On March 31, 2003, Krasnicki purchased 372,576 shares of newly issued treasury stock directly from OSC. The consideration Krasnicki paid for this stock was set by the board of directors pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 504 (a).
Krasnicki’s purchase of the subject shares conformed with the requirements of Business Corporation Law § 505 (d), and that transaction was approved by a majority of the shareholders. Despite petitioner’s contentions, there is no evidence before this court that respondent Krasnicki acquired the stock pursuant to a “tender offer,” as that term is used in article 16 of the Business Corporation Law.
Likewise, respondent Krasnicki was not making a “takeover bid.” The evidence before this court does not indicate that respondent Krasnicki was an “outsider” who was attempting “to wrest control away from incumbent management.” (See Black’s Law Dictionary 1454.) Rather, the evidence demonstrates that respondent Krasnicki was hired to cooperate with OSC due to both his demonstrated performance background, as well as his willingness to invest in OSC.
Petitioner’s motion for an order of injunction prohibiting respondent Krasnicki from acquiring and/or offering to acquire shares of common stock of OSC without first complying with Business Corporation Law article 16 is denied.
The temporary restraining order prohibiting OSC from issuing its treasury stock to respondent Krasnicki is vacated. Petitioner’s Request for OSC’s Shareholder Information
A shareholder’s right to inspect the books and records of a corporation is conditioned upon the shareholder’s good faith. (Matter of RDR Assoc., 63 AD2d 888, 889 [1st Dept 1978]; Matter of Wolberg v Wolberg Elec. Supply, 72 AD2d 903 [3d Dept 1979].)
“Improper purposes are those which are inimical to the corporation, for example, to discover business secrets to aid a competitor of the corporation, to secure prospects for personal business, to find technical defects in corporate transactions to institute ‘strike suits’, and to locate information to pursue one’s own social or political goals.” (Matter of Tatko v Tatko Bros. Slate Co., 173 AD2d 917, 917-918 [3d Dept 1991].)
Here, petitioner was removed from his position as OSC’s president and CEO in 2001 and was terminated from his employment with OSC in May 2002. The evidence provided to this court by the parties indicates that petitioner has characterized his relationship with OSC as “contentious” and that petitioner has allegedly expressed a desire, during the May 14, 2002 board of directors meeting, to “take the company down.” (See exhibit A to surreply of Edward J. Krasnicki, dated June 4, 2003.)
Respondents have raised a question as to whether petitioner’s request for information pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 624 is motivated by bad faith and/or improper motives. This court will schedule a hearing on the issue of good faith at a conference that will be set by chambers after an order on these motions is received and signed.
Petitioner’s motion to require OSC to permit petitioner and/or designated agents to inspect and make extracts from the records of shareholders of OSC pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 624 is denied without prejudice until a hearing on the issue of good faith is conducted. Petitioner’s request for attorneys’ fees is also denied without prejudice pending the hearing.",0

Michael V. Ajello, J.
In this CPLR article 78 proceeding, respondent IPRO moves to dismiss the petition upon the ground that this is not a proper article 78 proceeding and even if it were, petitioner cannot meet the “arbitrary and capricious” standard. The argument is made that article 78 is designed to be used for seeking mandamus against instrumentalities of the state or state officials, or disputes by members against membership corporations, not-for-profit associations or co-op boards regarding applications of mutually agreed upon rules or internal corporate governance and that recourse to an article 78 proceeding against a private corporation merely complying with state regulations, in its business, should not be permitted.
In 1998, the Legislature amended article 49 of the Insurance Law by adding a new title II giving an insured the right to an external appeal of an adverse determination by a health plan (L 1998, ch 586, § 29). At the same time, article 49 of the Public Health Law was amended by adding a new title II providing for the right of an external appeal (L 1998, ch 586, § 11). One of the purposes of the amendments was to provide insureds suffering from life-threatening or disabling diseases access to treatments that may be experimental or investigational if said treatments are more beneficial than any standard treatments or if beneficial treatments are provided pursuant to a clinical trial. The amendments also provided a mechanism for consumers to obtain an independent, impartial opinion regarding coverage determinations, as well as an expedited external review process so that there would be no delay in accessing beneficial services or treatments which are experimental or investigative in nature (Senate Mem in Support, 1998 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 1977).
The Governor, in his message on approving the amendments, stated that the bill demonstrates that New York is continuing to lead the nation in protecting the rights and health of its residents (Governor’s Mem approving L 1998, ch 586, 1998 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 1480).
The external appeal is conducted by an external appeal agent, such as respondent IPRO, which makes the ultimate decision as to whether the patient’s health costs will be covered by the health plan or the health plan’s denial of coverage will be upheld (Insurance Law § 4914). The Superintendent of Insurance is given the power to grant or revoke certificates to conduct external appeals (Insurance Law § 4911), as well as to review the activities of the external appeal agents, investigate complaints by insureds concerning requests for and processing external appeals and to conduct random audits to determine the external appeal agents’ compliance with title II (Insurance Law § 4916). The procedure for external appeals of adverse determinations is set forth in section 4914 of the Insurance Law.
Considering the statutory scheme, I find that external appeal agents function in an administrative capacity on behalf of the state. Furthermore, IPRO is a not-for-profit corporation, which comes within the definition of a “body” against whom an article 78 proceeding will lie (Schiffer v Tarrytown Boat Club, 219 AD2d 704 [1995], appeal dismissed 87 NY2d 916 [1996], rearg denied 87 NY2d 1056 [1996], cert denied 519 US 864 [1996], reh denied 519 US 1023 [1996]; Matter of Sines v Opportunities For Broome, 156 AD2d 878 [1989]).
Under the circumstances, an article 78 proceeding is the proper vehicle for reviewing the determination of IPRO to uphold the health plan’s denial of coverage. Insofar as IPRO alleges that petitioner will be unable to meet the “arbitrary and capricious” standard, this determination should be made after service of the answer.",0

George R. Peck, J.
Ordered that petitioner’s application for a judgment pursuant to article 78 of the CPLR, setting aside the election of Fire Commissioner for the Roosevelt Fire District, and the respondent’s motion for an order dismissing the within action are determined as follows:
In the majority of instances in New York State, for an individual to seek elective office, he or she must first circulate nominating petitions to registered voters in that political subdivision which encompasses that office so that the individual’s name can be placed on the ballot for the election.
In the instant matter, the petitioner, a resident within the Roosevelt Fire District and a duly registered voter who ran for the position of Fire Commissioner, alleges that the nominating petitions submitted by respondent Ronald McLean, the winner in that race, were defective, thus invalidating his victory. The election at issue was held on December 10, 2002, and the respondent Ronald McLean took office January 1, 2003.
The petitioner specifically alleges (1) that the Roosevelt Fire District did not comply with the requirements of Town Law § 175 in that no attempt was made to determine whether the nominating petitions of the respondent were valid, and (2) that the respondent was not a registered voter within the Roosevelt Fire District when he witnessed his nominating petitions.
The respondents move for an order dismissing the petition alleging first, the court lacks jurisdiction in that the action should have named the Secretary of the Roosevelt Fire District, and the officer in charge of the election as the proper party respondents; second, that the petitioner did not raise objections in a timely fashion to respondent Ronald McLean’s nominating petitions; and third, the present action is time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
Analysis
The question this court must determine first is one of first impression. Are the above-named respondents the proper parties against whom this action should be prosecuted? All authority over the actual conducting of an election for the office of fire district officers is vested with both the fire district secretary who prepares the ballots and the “resident fire district elector” who acts as chairman of the election. (See Town Law § 175.) The “resident fire district elector” is appointed by the sitting fire district officers as is the fire district secretary.
It is patently clear to this court that all power concerning the election of fire district officers vests with the sitting fire district board based upon their power to appoint those in charge of the election.
The failure of the petitioner in not naming the fire district secretary and the “resident fire district elector” as named respondents is an act that can best be described as de minimis and inconsequential; the sole duty of the two parties in charge of the election is ministerial. They have no substantive function beyond issuing a ballot and counting votes.
Consequently, the court hereby finds that jurisdiction does exist over the above-named respondents based upon their power to decide who is the fire district secretary and who is the “resident fire district elector.”
Nonetheless, the next question to answer is whether the petitioner’s untimely objections to the respondent Ronald McLean’s nominating petitions give rise to this court dismissing the petitioner’s application.
The legislation we have in place in New York State sets as its goals to have elections determined fairly, accurately and quickly. In New York State- an action relating to a nominating petition as we have here must be commenced within 14 days from the last date to file the petition at issue. The petitioner did not commence the present action until February 17, 2003, which is well beyond the statute of limitations set forth under the Election Law. (See Election Law § 16-102.)
Accordingly, based upon the failure of the petitioner to timely commence the instant application, petitioner’s application is hereby denied in its entirety.
“[Town Law] § 175. Election of fire district officers
“1. . . . The secretary of such fire district shall prepare the ballots for all elections of fire district officers and the polls shall remain open for the receipt thereof at all elections of fire district officers from six o’clock in the evening until nine o’clock in the evening and such additional consecutive hours prior thereto as the board of fire commissioners of such district may have determined and specified in the notice thereof. The board of fire commissioners shall designate a resident fire district elector, who shall be a registered voter of the town, to act as chairman of any election of said district and shall designate not less than two nor more than four resident fire district electors, who shall be registered voters of the town to act as election inspectors and ballot clerks at such elections. No elective officer of the fire district shall serve as such chairman or as an election inspector or ballot clerk. The board of fire commissioners may adopt a resolution providing that such chairman, election inspectors and ballot clerks shall be paid for their respective services at any such annual election or at any special election of the fire district . . . .”",0

Susan T. Kluewer, J.
The People’s motion to reargue defendant’s motion to dismiss this action pursuant to CPL 30.30 (1) (b) and 170.30 (1) (e) is granted. On reargument, I adhere to the original determination. The dismissal stands.
By District Court information, albeit a jurisdictionally defective one, defendant stood accused, as of September 2001, of the class A misdemeanor of failing to “register” as a sex offender (see Correction Law art 6-C). Defendant was arraigned on that instrument on September 19, 2001. By virtue, of the arraignment, this court acquired jurisdiction over his person as well as authority to conduct the numerous pretrial proceedings had in this action (see CPL 1.20 [9], [18]; see also People v Gonzalez, 181 Misc 2d 105 [Crim Ct, NY County 1998, Billings, J.]).
In the almost 20 months and some 35 court appearances that followed defendant’s arraignment, the People engaged in such pretrial proceedings as preparing and serving “VDF’s”; filing additional supporting depositions to supplement those annexed to the first filed accusatory instrument; filing a certificate of readiness premised on that supplemented accusatory instrument; belatedly delivering that certificate to defense counsel; obtaining, eventually, defendant’s rearraignment on the “supplemented” accusatory instrument; successfully defending against defendant’s motion to dismiss — for facial insufficiency — the first filed, supplemented accusatory instrument; requesting adjournments of scheduled trial dates because of the claimed unavailability of a witness; making motions in limine— days before a jury was to have been selected — about the admissibility of evidence; and, during the course of those in limine proceedings, finally coming to grips with their wholesale failure to analyze and appreciate what they actually accused defendant of failing to do. Notwithstanding the denial of defendant’s earlier motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument as defective, the People at last realized that the first filed accusatory instrument was, even as supplemented by the additional supporting depositions, totally inadequate as a trial ready accusatory instrument. They thus, on March 28, 2003, filed a superceding information. They also then filed, and this time simultaneously served, another certificate of readiness. Shortly thereafter, defendant moved to dismiss the action on account of the People’s failure to timely be ready for trial.
Because of the level of offense charged, the People were obligated to announce and actually be ready for trial, exclusive of certain statutorily specified periods, within 90 days of this action’s commencement (see CPL 30.30 [1] [b]; see also CPL 30.30 [3] [b]; [4]). On the underlying “30.30” motion, each side set forth calculations and arguments concerning days to be included and excluded in determining how long the People remained unready to try this case. The record then before me made plain that, although some of the lengthy time the action had been pending should not be included in the calculations (see CPL 30.30 [4]), the People nonetheless had exceeded the 90-day period the Legislature has allotted them. By order dated May 27, 2003, I thus granted defendant’s motion and dismissed the action pursuant to CPL 30.30 (1) (b) and 170.30 (1) (e). In doing so, I addressed the People’s then “alternative” and, to me, ironic argument to the virtual effect that they are entitled to a “do over” precisely because they remained so uninformed about the accusation they made against defendant that they could not prepare a legally sufficient accusatory instrument until over 18 months after defendant was first haled into court. I acknowledged in my order of dismissal their citation of two Appellate Term cases, neither of which is officially reported, holding that the filing of an accusatory instrument that is jurisdictionally defective does not actually “commence” an action; that a jurisdictionally insufficient information does not confer even “preliminary jurisdiction” over a defendant; that a jurisdiction-ally insufficient information, and, inferentially, every proceeding taken under it, are “nullities”; and that, therefore, the “speedy trial” time does not begin to run until a jurisdictionally sufficient information is filed (see People v Gross, App Term, 2d Dept 1996, Docket No. 95-873 NCR; People v Phillips, App Term, 2d Dept 1994, Docket No. 93-800 NCR). Because of higher controlling authority to the contrary, I ruled that their “alternative” argument was no basis for denying defendant’s motion, and, indeed, was contrary to the very purpose of CPL 30.30 as explained by that higher authority because it would work to reward rather than prevent prosecutorial delay in conducting such basic trial preparation functions as actual analysis of the charge lodged and the proof necessary to support it.
On this reargument motion, the People abandon the claim that they were ready for trial within 90 days of the filing of the original accusatory instrument. Their present opposition to defendant’s motion is limited to the claims that the doctrine of stare decisis requires that I follow the two unreported Appellate Term cases they previously cited and continue to rely on; that CPL 30.30 has no application to jurisdictionally defective accusatory instruments; and that, since, according to these Appellate Term cases, this court does not have even “preliminary jurisdiction” over defendant, everything that preceded the March 28, 2003 filing of the superceding information is a “nullity.” They in effect repeat that, after all this time and activity, they are entitled to an entirely new and different 90-day period within which to get ready for trial. I disagree.
As I noted in my order of May 27, 2003, the Legislature has dictated that, where the People are not ready for trial within a statutorily specified period (here, 90 days plus any excluded periods) that is measured from commencement of the action, the court “must” grant a defendant’s motion to dismiss (see CPL 30.30 [1] [b]). The Legislature has also dictated that an action is commenced with the “filing” of an “accusatory instrument” against the defendant (CPL 1.20 [16]). The Legislature did not qualify that dictate by providing that the accusatory instrument be jurisdictionally sufficient, and, in fact, specifically recognized that successive accusatory instruments can be filed in the course of a criminal action. It thus prescribed that a criminal action includes “the filing of all further accusatory instruments directly derived from the initial one” (CPL 1.20 [16] [b]; [17]). It further dictated, again without qualification or condition, that “if more than one accusatory instrument is filed in the course of an action, [the action] commences when the first of such instruments is filed” (CPL 1.20 [17] [emphasis added]; see also CPL 100.05). Moreover, the Legislature has expressed its appreciation that, while the filing of a particular accusatory instrument commences an action and, via a defendant’s arraignment thereon, provides the basis for a court’s exercise of jurisdiction over his or her person “with respect to such accusatory instrument” and with respect to “setting the course of further proceedings in the action” (see CPL 1.20 [9]; see also CPL 1.20 [18]), that same document is not necessarily jurisdiction-ally adequate for trial (CPL 1.20 [7], [8]; cf. CPL 30.30 [5] [b]).
The Court of Appeals applied these clear dictates in People v Lomax (50 NY2d 351 [1980]). In Lomax, the People commenced the action by filing a felony complaint, a document that can never support a felony conviction (see CPL 1.20 [3], [8]; see also CPL arts 195, 200; cf. People v Alejandro, 70 NY2d 133 [1987]). They then obtained an indictment apparently premised on insufficient grand jury evidence, and, when that indictment was dismissed because of the insufficiency, the People obtained a second indictment, this time one that was sufficient to support the felony prosecution and a judgment of conviction. Although it ultimately affirmed denial of the defendant’s ensuing motion to dismiss pursuant to CPL 30.30 because his motion papers were inadequate, the Court of Appeals nonetheless made clear that analysis of defendant’s “speedy trial” claim must begin with determining when the action against him was “commenced,” which it ruled is not when the People obtained the second, valid indictment, but when the first accusatory instrument, there a felony complaint, was filed. In interpreting and applying the “carefully structured definitional provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law,” it ruled that
“there can be only one criminal action for each set of charges brought against a particular defendant, notwithstanding that the original accusatory instrument may be replaced or superceded during the course of the action. This is so even in cases such as this, where the original accusatory instrument was dismissed outright and the defendant was subsequently haled into court under an entirely new [instrument]” {supra at 356 [emphasis added]).
The Court of Appeals in Lomax noted that a criminal action is to have “continuity” even through the issuance of successive accusatory instruments, and it reasoned that, if there can be only one criminal action for any given set of criminal charges, there also can be only one commencement date, i.e., the date “on which the first accusatory paper is filed” {id. [emphasis added]).
Shortly thereafter, in People v Osgood (52 NY2d 37 [1980]), the Court of Appeals again set forth these principles, this time in the context of two criminal actions commenced by the filing of felony complaints that were dismissed because of the People’s failure to timely proceed on those complaints. The Court of Appeals ruled that each action was commenced, not upon the filing of the indictments sufficient to support the prosecution, but upon the filing of the first accusatory instrument, i.e., the felony complaints. In addition to quoting at some length from its holding in Lomax, the Court of Appeals noted that “[i]t would, of course, be inconsistent, if not perverse, for the Legislature to provide that a statute, designed to insure to the public diligent prosecution of criminal charges filed in court, should be suspended when the District Attorney has inexcusably delayed the prosecution of the case” (People v Osgood, supra at 41-42). It also took the opportunity to discredit the People’s argument that the filing of the indictment marked the commencement of a new “30.30” period as that argument would apply in the non-felony context. The Court of Appeals thus noted that, in non-felony prosecutions, the People’s argument would “completely undermine the readiness rule” because, under their theory, the filing of a new accusatory instrument would commence “a new criminal action renewing the statutory period” and allow “additional ‘renewals’, apparently without limit, unless . . . there was a showing of ‘bad faith’ in addition to neglect” (id. at 45 n 2). It observed that, in nonfelony cases, there would be no fixed time limit and “the readiness rule would simply be converted into a bad faith rule” (id.). In that regard, the Court of Appeals commented that “[i]t is no answer to say that the speedy trial provisions in other statutes and the Constitution will ultimately fix an outside limit. If the Legislature had found those provisions to be an adequate response to the problem of pretrial delay in the criminal courts, it would not have enacted CPL 30.30” (id.).
Several years later, in People v Sinistaj (67 NY2d 236 [1986]), the Court of Appeals held that, just as any subsequently filed accusatory instrument relates back to the date the first accusatory paper is filed for the purpose of determining when an action is commenced, the rules of statutory construction require that it interpret CPL 30.30 to similarly mandate that any excludable time arising under the replaced or superceded instrument be deducted from the total period the action is pending when determining whether the People are timely ready for trial on the later filed, trial ready document. It ruled that this construction was entirely consistent with the purpose of CPL 30.30 as a prosecutorial readiness rule, and was not unfair to defendants because
“[t]he District Attorney remains entitled to but one [statutory] readiness period. The issuance of a successive indictment neither affords him additional excludable time nor does it renew, toll, or in any way supplement that single [statutory readiness] limitation which always commences to run upon the filing of the initial accusatory instrument” (id. at 241 [emphasis added]; see also People v Worley, 66 NY2d 523 [1985]).
These principles are also observed and followed by the Appellate Division. In People v Bantum (133 AD2d 699 [2d Dept 1987]), the Second Department ruled that the People’s time, and any excludable time, each related back to the filing of a felony complaint, even though the first indictment was dismissed because of a jurisdictional defect. In People v Kanter (173 AD2d 560 [2d Dept 1991]), a case apparently commenced by the filing of an indictment, it ruled that excludable delays attributable to the defendant occurring during the pendency of the first indictment, later dismissed as jurisdictionally defective, were to be deducted from the overall period the action was pending in determining whether the People were ready to proceed under a later filed, valid indictment. And in Matter of Tommy C. (182 AD2d 312 [2d Dept 1992]), it applied the principles enunciated in People v Lomax {supra) to a juvenile delinquency proceeding and ruled that a juvenile’s appearance on a petition later dismissed for facial insufficiency nonetheless marked the commencement date for computing the time within which the presentment agency must be ready to proceed with a fact-finding hearing on a subsequently filed, jurisdictionally adequate petition. The other Departments have issued similar rulings (see e.g. People v Flowers, 240 AD2d 894 [3d Dept 1997]; People v Toro, 151 AD2d 142 [1st Dept 1989]; People v Zirpola, 88 AD2d 758 [4th Dept 1982], mod on other grounds 57 NY2d 706 [1982]).
These principles could not be clearer: it is the filing of an accusatoiy paper that commences a criminal action; the criminal action that is thereby commenced encompasses all accusatory instruments filed during its course, even if the first filed instrument is replaced, superceded or dismissed outright-, for “30.30” purposes, there can be only one criminal action for each set of criminal charges against a particular defendant; the People are entitled to only one “30.30” period within which to get ready for trial; and the “30.30” period always starts to run when the first accusatory instrument is filed.
The People’s arguments that their September 2001 filing of a paper they labeled and used as a District Court information for some 18 months did not commence the running of the “30.30” time limitation; that their September 2001 invocation of this court’s jurisdiction over defendant’s person and over the ensuing pretrial proceedings involving some 35 court appearances never really happened; and that, in effect, they get another “30.30” period within which to get ready for trial, are totally inconsistent with these clearly stated principles. Indeed, it is, obviously, the People’s obligation to secure and file an accusatory instrument sufficient to support the prosecution and any judgment of conviction, and their failure to do so is one of the most tell-tale indicia of a lack of readiness (see People v Colon, 59 NY2d 921 [1983]). To paraphrase the Court of Appeals in People v Osgood (supra), for the Legislature to provide that a statute that is designed to insure the public of diligent prosecution of criminal charges also allows the People, in cases where they prepare and file a jurisdictionally defective accusatory instrument, to decline, over the course of months or years, to analyze their case so as to reveal the defects in the instrument, and then excuses their lack of diligence by authorizing them to start all over again, perhaps as many times as is necessary for them to get it right, would be inconsistent, if not perverse. Moreover, application of the People’s Alice-in-Wonderland-like argument would have the even more perverse effect of nullifying all pretrial rulings made and proceedings had before the People get around to correcting the defect in the accusatory instrument, thus inviting defendants charged under accusatory instruments later ruled defective — which sometimes happens for the first time on appeal — to refuse to appear, and to refuse to obey other court mandates, such as orders of protection, that are tied to the commencement and pendency of the action. It could also undermine the viability of related prosecutions such as those for bail jumping and criminal contempt.
I am fully cognizant of the bedrock principle of jurisprudence known as stare decisis. That principle requires that I accept the interpretation of a statute as “laid down in the opinions of the highest court of the state” to have construed the statute (see McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 72 [b]; see also People v Pestana, 195 Misc 2d 833 [Crim Ct, NY County 2003, Jaffe, J.]; cf. Mountain View Coach Lines v Storms, 102 AD2d 663 [2d Dept 1984]). Apart from the question of whether unreported and not officially reported Appellate Term cases are mandatory authority or are instead merely persuasive (see People v Pestana, supra; Yellow Book of NY v Dimilia, 188 Misc 2d 489 [Nassau Dist Ct 2001, Gartner, J.]), the Appellate Term is not in any event the highest court to have addressed the “30.30” issue presented here. Moreover, I note that, when it ruled that an accusatory instrument does not give a court even “preliminary jurisdiction” to proceed if that instrument contains a jurisdictional defect (but see CPL 1.20 [9], [18]), that such an accusatory instrument is a “nullity,” and that, therefore, the “30.30” time does not begin to run until a jurisdictionally adequate accusatory instrument is filed, the Appellate Term engaged in no express analysis of the statutory purpose of CPL 30.30 and its construction and application by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the Appellate Term neither cited nor purported to rely on any “30.30” cases whatsoever. It instead relied on two cases — People v Alejandro (supra) and People v Key (45 NY2d 111 [1978]) — having nothing to do with the interpretation and application of CPL 30.30. The former stands for the principles that an accusatory instrument containing a nonwaivable jurisdictional defect cannot support a judgment of conviction, and that the issue of the defect can be raised for the first time on appeal. The latter stands for the propositions that a defendant can waive a nonjurisdictional defect in an accusatory instrument, and that, if an accusatory instrument is so fundamentally defective that it would not support a judgment of conviction, jeopardy never attaches to it. In neither Alejandro nor Key did the Court of Appeals address when or how an action is commenced, address or even refer to the concept of “preliminary jurisdiction,” and the word “nullity” appears nowhere in either decision.
I regard the Appellate Term cases on which the People rely as contrary to the clear rulings of appellate courts of superior jurisdiction. Thus, even if unreported and not officially reported Appellate Term cases containing no analysis of CPL 30.30 and its purpose were otherwise controlling (but see People v Pestana, supra; Yellow Book of NY v Dimilia, supra), I am bound to follow the construction of CPL 30.30 as enunciated by those higher appellate courts (see Statutes § 72 [b]; People v Pestana, supra; and see Mountain View Coach Lines v Storms, supra). I did so in my original determination and I do so again here. And, since the People failed to be ready for trial within 90 days of their initial filing of an accusatory instrument, I must dismiss this action (CPL 30.30).
The People now also come forward with another Appellate Term case, this one issued by the Second and Eleventh Districts and reported in the law journal only, that adopts the proposition that the filing of a jurisdictionally defective accusatory instrument does not commence an action. The only authority it cites is one of the two Appellate Term cases the People assert are controlling here.",0
0502-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Martin E. Ritholtz, J.
What is the effect of a preclusion order? Is it enforceable only against the defaulting party; or, once testimony is precluded, are all parties bound by said preclusion? This is one of the issues raised in the instant motion.
Background
Plaintiff commenced this action on January 24, 2000 to recover money damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of a two-car collision at the intersection of 59th Street and Second Avenue, Manhattan, New York, on September 24, 1998, between one driven by defendant Yasser S. Salama, in whose vehicle the plaintiff was a back seat passenger, and the other driven by defendant Ronnie Masih. Issue was joined on or about July 17, 2000.
On April 5, 2001, a preliminary conference was held which resulted in an order signed by the Honorable Joseph G. Golia, and which directed that party depositions be conducted on May 23, 2001. It appears that plaintiff was deposed on June 21, 2001, and defendant Salama was deposed on February 4, 2002.
A compliance conference was held in this part on February 28, 2002, and an order was issued, mandating that the outstanding deposition of defendants Excellence Transportation, Inc. and Ronnie Masih be conducted on March 21, 2002. Upon the default of said defendants, the parties entered into a “so ordered” stipulation on May 9, 2002, which provided that defendant Masih was to be produced for deposition no later than July 9, 2002, and should there be a further default, “the parties shall schedule a phone conference with the Judge’s chambers.” Once again said defendants defaulted, and despite noncompliance with three court orders, they were allotted one final opportunity to appear for deposition on October 1, 2002, pursuant to a telephone conference which resulted in a further “so ordered” stipulation dated August 16, 2002. Said stipulation provided that “If defendant Masih fails to appear, he will be precluded from offering testimony at the time of the trial of this action.” Defendant Masih again failed to appear for deposition on October 1, 2002.
Taking the position that the preclusion only operated against the defaulting defendant, exclusively prohibiting him from offering testimony on his own behalf, plaintiffs counsel persevered and sought the deposition of said defendant by way of subpoena for plaintiffs purposes of also possibly inculpating the codefendant Salama by means of said deposition testimony. It appears that without much effort, plaintiff was able to effectuate personal service of the subpoena on defendant Masih on October 12, 2002, via a process server, at his residence, which was the same address indicated on the face of the summons in this action, dated January 6, 2000. Pursuant to said subpoena, defendant Masih appeared for the deposition held on December 20, 2002, with the participation of all parties. Notwithstanding receiving prior notice of the deposition well in advance, Joseph Orlando, Esq., counsel for codefendants New Style Limousine, Inc. and Yasser S. Salama, never moved to quash the subpoena or to enjoin the proposed deposition, but, instead noted his objection “to the taking of the deposition at this time and the use of any deposition testimony from this day forward.” Nor did Mr. Orlando refuse to participate in the deposition, but, on the contrary, actively asked questions and elicited testimony of the defendant Masih. At said deposition, defendant Masih testified, inter alia, that at the time of the accident he proceeded with a green light, while the codefendant Salama “crossed a red light” and hit his car.
The Instant Motion
The defendants Excellence Transportation, Inc. and Ronnie Masih move herein to vacate the stipulation which precludes defendant Masih from testifying at trial. Counsel for said defendants offers as exhibit A, annexed to the motion, a copy of the first page of approximately 15 reports issued from his investigator, Odin Claims, as evidence of efforts made to secure the cooperation of defendant Masih in defending this action. Said defendants further contend that since the deposition was eventually held with the participation of all the parties, the sanction of preclusion is unwarranted.
Codefendants New Style Limousine, Inc. and Yasser S. Salama vigorously oppose the motion, arguing that once defendant Masih failed to comply with the conditional “so ordered” stipulation, that stipulated order is now absolute. They note that no order vacating said conditional stipulation was ever granted prior to the deposition of December 20, 2002. Said codefendants further contend that plaintiff should also be precluded from presenting the testimony of defendant Masih, since “counsel for plaintiff signed off on the stipulation (of August 16, 2002) and is completely bound by it.”
Plaintiff partially opposes the instant motion. According to plaintiff, the defendant Masih should be precluded from offering testimony on his own behalf, based on his repeated willful defaults, and in not complying with the conditional “so ordered” stipulation of preclusion. Nevertheless, it is plaintiffs contention that there is no reason to punish and preclude plaintiff for the defaults of defendant Masih. Plaintiff argues that she should not “be deprived of the opportunity to prove the liability of defendants, New Style Limousine and Salama, by introducing Mr. Masih’s testimony that he had a green light and the other driver Mr. Salama had the red light.”
The Complete Investigative Reports
On the return date of this motion, when confronted with incomplete reports, annexed to the moving papers as exhibit A, of the efforts made by movants’ investigator to secure the cooperation of defendant Masih, the court suggested to the parties that a hearing be held on an adjourned date, at which time the investigator would testify in detail as to the efforts made and as to the reasons defendant Masih failed to comply with three court orders. In lieu of said hearing, the parties stipulated that they “have been given the opportunity to examine the complete letters from Odin Claims regarding their efforts to locate Mr. Masih, which will he incorporated as part of this motion.”
Upon review of the letters, it appears that Odin Claims, Inc. was first hired by counsel for movants to investigate the whereabouts of defendant Masih on May 21, 2002. It further appears that a letter was sent by said investigator to defendant Masih on May 23, 2002, which was acknowledged by said defendant in a telephone call to the investigator on June 19, 2002. According to an “Investigative Summary,” defendant Masih indicated during said telephone call “that he had been too busy to call us and did not appear concerned with cooperating with us.” Several follow-up letters were sent to defendant Masih which were apparently ignored, and in an investigative report of October 15, 2002, the investigator concluded in a “Summary” that “It appears that Mr. Masih is refusing to cooperate.” In the investigative report of November 22, 2002, the following is stated, inter alia, “You advised us on 11/15/02 that plaintiffs [sic] indicated that they [sic] had subpoenaed our insured . . . We eventually reached Mr. Masih on 11/21/02. He reiterated that he worked 7 days a week and has no time to attend a deposition. At length, we convinced him to cooperate so as not to jeopardize his insurance coverage and representation, not to mention the fact that he was a named defendant and had been subpoenaed by the other side.”
The last investigative report of December 23, 2002 indicates how defendant Masih was transported to the deposition of December 20, 2002 and brought back “to his residence at 45-30 Smart Street, Flushing, New York. This concludes our investigation. Thank you for this assignment.” As noted earlier, this is the same address, which appeared on the face of the summons in this action, dated January 6, 2000.
Legal Analysis
(a) What Constitutes a Willful Default, and is Preclusion Warranted?
It is well settled that the penalty of preclusion is extreme and should only be levied when the failure to disclose has been willful or contumacious {see CPLR 3126 [2]; Garcia v Kraniotakis, 232 AD2d 369 [1996]; Moran v Franklin Gen. Hosp., 214 AD2d 707 [1995]). A “pattern of willful default and neglect” should not be excused (see Titan Realty Corp. v Schlem, 283 AD2d 568, 568 [2001]; Wynne v Wagner, 262 AD2d 556 [1999]; Roussodimou v Zafiriadis, 238 AD2d 568 [1997]; Fujah v V-M Auto Refinishing Corp., 192 Misc 2d 170, 175 [2002]). Defendant Masih’s failure was part of a pattern of “ ‘repeated neglect’ rather than an ‘isolated, inadvertent mistake’ ” (see North Fork Bank v Martin, 257 AD2d 613, 613 [1999]). The willful and contumacious character of defendant Masih’s default can be inferred from his noncompliance with four separate court orders directing depositions, coupled with either no excuses or an inadequate excuse for these defaults (see Blake v Chawla, 299 AD2d 437 [2002]; Kingsley v Kantor, 265 AD2d 529 [1999]; DiDomenico v C & S Aeromatik Supplies, 252 AD2d 41 [1998]; Argenio v Cushman & Wakefield, 227 AD2d 578 [1996]; Porreco v Selway, 225 AD2d 752 [1996]; Polito v DeTomaso, 208 AD2d 912 [1994]).
Certain aggravating factors unique to this case further bolster the finding of willful default. The preliminary conference order of April 5, 2001 put counsel for defendant Masih on notice that said defendant was to be deposed on May 23, 2001. Upon the default of defendant Masih, a subsequent compliance conference order dated February 28, 2002 gave his counsel until March 21, 2002 to produce him for the outstanding deposition. Again defendant Masih defaulted, and it was only after the “so ordered” stipulation of May 9, 2002 that his counsel hired an investigator to find him, over one year after the preliminary conference order of April 5, 2001. To further exacerbate the situation, the investigator’s letters document that from May 23, 2002 until November 21, 2002, defendant Masih indicated that he had no time to attend a deposition, and refused to cooperate. In other words, in the face of a “so ordered” stipulation of May 9, 2002, which directed a deposition no later than July 9, 2002, and confronted with a stipulated conditional order of preclusion of August 16, 2002, affording defendant Masih one final opportunity to be deposed on October 1, 2002, he nevertheless refused to appear. To add insult to injury, after flaunting four court orders, defendant Masih was “convinced” to appear for the December 20, 2002 deposition, in the words of the investigator, because “he had been subpoenaed by the other side.”
Were this pattern not enough to justify preclusion, this case also involves a default of a conditional preclusion order, where it is well established, that when a party fails to comply with a conditional order of preclusion, the order becomes absolute (see Goldsmith Motors Corp. v Chemical Bank, 300 AD2d 440 [2002]; Jenkinson v Naccarato, 286 AD2d 420 [2001]; Kepple v Hill Assoc., 275 AD2d 299 [2000]; Ha v B.H.N.V. Realty Corp., 273 AD2d 458 [2000]; Alphonse v UBJ Inc., 266 AD2d 171 [1999]; Tirone v Staten Is. Univ. Hosp., 264 AD2d 415 [1999]; Barriga v Sapo, 250 AD2d 795 [1998]; Michaud v City of New York, 242 AD2d 369 [1997]; Rodriguez v Colasuonno, 238 AD2d 329 [1997]; Orabi v George Hildebrandt, Inc., 157 AD2d 506 [1990]). Even though the deposition was eventually held, the plaintiff never entered into a stipulation waiving her right to seek enforcement of the preclusion order (cf. Patterson v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 284 AD2d 516 [2001]). Furthermore, although movant defendants seek herein to vacate the preclusion, it has long been held that “Orders of preclusion may not be ignored with impunity and they may be vacated only upon the showing of ‘extraordinary and exceptional circumstances’ ” (see Jones v Bryce, 76 AD2d 966, 966-967 [1980]; see also, Johnson v Heavy Realty Corp., 191 AD2d 538 [1993]). In order to avoid the adverse impact of an order of preclusion, the party seeking vacatur must establish, inter alia, a reasonable excuse for the default (see Correa v Kewal, 281 AD2d 448 [2001]; Boland v Biordi, 251 AD2d 524 [1998]; Vanek v Mercy Hosp., 162 AD2d 680 [1990]; Mariani v Fleishman, 160 AD2d 911 [1990]). Under the circumstances herein, as noted at length above, vacatur of the preclusion, as it impacts on defendant Masih, is unwarranted.
Parenthetically, should you ask, what did defendant Masih gain by appearing at the deposition of December 20, 2002, especially in light of an absence of a vacatur or waiver, and having been precluded from offering any testimony at the time of trial? The answer is, simply, that said defendant still faced a more severe sanction of striking his answer, pursuant to CPLR 3126 (3), and avoided it by appearing at the deposition of December 20, 2002 (cf. Alizio v Alizio, 300 AD2d 515 [2002]; Bates v Baez, 299 AD2d 382 [2002]; Cavallino v Sonsky, 251 AD2d 361 [1998]; Torres v Martinez, 250 AD2d 759 [1998]; Rowe v Sook, 224 AD2d 404 [1996]; Boera v Batz, 236 AD2d 349 [1997]).
(b) Unilateral/Partial Preclusion or Multilateral/Absolute Preclusion?
Codefendants New Style Limousine, Inc. and Yasser S. Salama contend that the stipulation of August 16, 2002, providing that “If defendant Masih fails to appear, he will be precluded from offering testimony at the time of trial of this action,” is a binding contract, which operates as an absolute preclusion, effectively barring all parties from offering defendant Masih’s testimony. The court rejects this contention. The language of the stipulation clearly provides that “If defendant Masih fails to appear, he will be precluded” (emphasis supplied), and there is no provision precluding plaintiff or codefendants from offering defendant Masih’s testimony.
Furthermore, the circumstances which necessitated the subject stipulation belie codefendants’ position. The earlier “so ordered” stipulation of May 9, 2002 provided that if defendant Masih further defaulted, the parties would schedule a phone conference with the court, in order to avoid unnecessary motion practice. Plaintiff had sought immediate sanctions against the defaulting defendant, pursuant to CPLR 3126, but, instead, as a result of a telephone conference, entered into the “so ordered,” conditional preclusion stipulation of August 16, 2002, in lieu of a motion, affording said defendant one final opportunity to appear for deposition. It is well settled that the nature and degree of the penalty to be imposed pursuant to CPLR 3126 against a party who has refused to obey an order of disclosure is a matter within the discretion of the court (see Jaffe v Hubbard, 299 AD2d 395 [2002]; Nowak v Veira, 289 AD2d 383 [2001]). It was never the intention of the parties in a telephone conference with the court to impose sanctions for nondisclosure on any other party than the nondisclosing party, i.e., defendant Masih. The Court of Appeals succinctly sets forth the scope of a preclusion order, pursuant to CPLR 3126 (2), as follows: “The sanctions for failure to comply . . . include a preclusion order preventing the nondisclosing party from using the evidence in any manner during the course of the litigation” (Northway Eng’g v Felix Indus., 77 NY2d 332, 335 [1991] [emphasis added]). Plaintiff bore no responsibility for the failure of defendant Masih to testify on four different occasions, and it would therefore be wholly unfair to punish plaintiff by precluding her from offering said defendant’s testimony.
Conclusion
For all the reasons mentioned above, the court denies the within motion of defendants Excellence Transportation, Inc. and Ronnie Masih to vacate the “so ordered” conditional preclusion stipulation of August 16, 2002.",0
0192-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Doris Ling-Cohan, J.
Before the court are two orders to show cause seeking amicus curiae status. The underlying action was brought by New York State Senator Carl Kruger against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, and the New York City Department (or Board) of Education (collectively known as City) seeking to set aside a proposed reorganization of the New York City school system as a de facto elimination of community school districts in violation of various provisions of the Education Law. The proposed reorganization is part of the “Children First” reform plan issued by the Chancellor, which would affect the approximately 1,200 schools, servicing 1.1 million students.
On consent of the parties, three New York State Senators, six New York State Assemblymen, six New York City Council members, two Representatives of the United States Congress, parents and parent leaders, past and present officials of the city school system, and a union leader who represents employees in the school system intervened.
Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning (PENCIL) and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York have each moved by order to show cause to appear as amicus curiae in this matter. PENCIL is a not-for-profit organization devoted to public education issues by contributing to the improvement of New York City public schools through active and meaningful civic involvement by the private sector. In addition to its other programs which bring much needed resources to the public schools, PENCIL’S flagship program, principal for a day, brings civic leaders into the public schools. The Association of the Bar is a professional organization of attorneys with more than 22,000 members. One of its standing committees is the Committee on Education and the Law, which has focused, in addition to other issues, on the governance of the New York City school system.
In signing the orders to show cause setting forth a return date and a schedule for any opposition papers, the court has considered the standard for amicus curiae. This written decision sets forth the standard of review that this court has employed in rendering its decision to sign these orders to show cause, in an attempt to be helpful to the bench and bar, given that there are few decisions addressing the issue of amicus curiae in the trial courts.
The usual method for intervention into an existing lawsuit is by CPLR 1012 or 1013; the sections are designated as “intervention by right” (CPLR 1012) or “intervention by permission” (CPLR 1013). None of the intervention statutes set forth in the CPLR use the words “amicus curiae,” but they have been used to allow such intervention. (See Siegel, NY Prac § 182, at 298 [3d ed].)
CPLR 1012 (a) (3) provides: “[U]pon timely motion, any person shall be permitted to intervene in any action . . . [w]hen the action involves the disposition or distribution of, or the title or a claim of damages for injury to property and the person may be adversely affected by the judgment.” Alternatively, intervention by permission is appropriate “[u]pon timely motion, any person may be permitted to intervene in any action . . . when the person’s claim or defense and the main action have a common question of law or fact. In exercising its discretion, the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay the determination of the action or prejudice the substantial rights of any party.” (CPLR 1013.)
In a CPLR article 78 proceeding, such as this one, CPLR 7802 (d) confers upon the courts “broader authority to allow intervention . . . than is permitted” under the general intervention provisions. (Roosevelt Islanders for Responsible Southtown Dev. v Roosevelt Is. Operating Corp., 291 AD2d 40, 48 [1st Dept 2001]; see also Matter of Greater N.Y. Health Care Facilities Assn. v DeBuono, 91 NY2d 716, 720 [1998].) Such section provides that in proceedings brought pursuant to article 78, “[t]he court . . . may allow other interested parties to intervene.” (CPLR 7802 [d].) However, to be an “interested” party, one must have a legally cognizable claim to intervene pursuant to CPLR 7802 (d), rather than just a general interest in the result of the article 78. (Matter of New York Times Co. v City of N.Y. Fire Dept., 195 Misc 2d 119, 122-123 [Sup Ct, NY County 2003], citing Matter of Greater N.Y. Health Care Facilities Assn., 91 NY2d at 718, 720-721; Ferguson v Barrios-Paoli, 279 AD2d 396, 398-399 [1st Dept 2001].)
“Once let in, the intervenor becomes a party for all purposes.” (Siegel, NY Prac § 178, at 295 [3d ed]; see Incorporated Vil. of Is. Park v Island Park-Long Beach, 81 NYS2d 407 [1948], affd 274 App Div 930 [2d Dept 1948].) A party who intervenes, if the motion is granted, obtains the rights of a party, including the right to counterclaim, cross-claim, implead, appeal, etc. (Siegel, NY Prac § 183, at 300 [3d ed]; see Brown v Waryas, 45 Misc 2d 77, 78 [Sup Ct, Duchess County 1965].)
Here, PENCIL and the Association of the Bar do not seek to intervene with the full rights of a party but to act as a “friend of the court” by providing a memorandum of law. Thus, the appropriate analysis to be applied is similar to the review an appellate court uses in determining whether to grant amicus status.
Amicus curiae has been defined as “one who, as a standerby, when a judge is in doubt or mistaken in a matter of law, may inform the court.” (Kemp v Rubin, 187 Misc 707, 708 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1946].) “[T]he function of an ‘amicus curiae’ is to call the court’s attention to law or facts or circumstances in a matter . . . that might otherwise escape its consideration; it is a privilege and not a right; he is not a party, and cannot assume the functions of a party; he must accept the case before the court with issues made by the parties, and may not control the litigation.” {Id. at 709.)
There are few cases addressing such applications in the trial court, in part because the parties may stipulate to amicus curiae status. (See e.g. Matter of New York Times Co. v City of N.Y. Fire Dept., 195 Misc 2d 119 [Sup Ct, NY County 2003].) Certainly, where the trial court needs to obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before the court, it can invite the expert to file a brief amicus curiae, provided that it gives notice to the parties of the person consulted and a copy of such advice, and afford the parties reasonable opportunity to respond. (Rules of Judicial Conduct [22 NYCRR] § 100.3 [B] [6] [b].) “In cases involving questions of important public interest leave is generally granted to file a brief as amicus curiae.” (Colmes v Fisher, 151 Misc 222, 223 [Sup Ct, Erie County 1934].) “Unlike the typical intervenor, amici are quite often large organizations or associations that represent a particular interest group.” (Davies, Stecich, and Gold, New York Civil Appellate Practice § 8:4 [8 West’s NY Prac Series 1996].)
Even when intervention is denied, the party seeking to intervene may still be permitted to appear as amicus curiae. (See Finkelstein, Mauriello, Kaplan & Levine v McGuirk, 90 Misc 2d 649, 650-651 [Sup Ct, Orange County 1977].) Where the movant “begs leave of the court to intervene as a party in this action” but “asserts no right against anyone, nor claims no duty owing by anyone,” he may nevertheless “be of assistance to the court as amicus curiae” and “allowed to introduce argument, authority or evidence to protect his interests.” (Ladue v Goodhead, 181 Misc 807, 811 [Erie County Ct 1943].) Where a person is uniquely qualified to give relevant testimony, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, may call the amicus curiae to give testimony. (See e.g. Matter of George “Joey” S., 194 AD2d 328 [1st Dept 1993].)
Where all possible points of view were represented by counsel, the application to appear as amicus will be denied, as nothing would be served by allowing additional appearances. (See Matter of Mayer, 110 Misc 2d 346, 351 [Sur Ct, NY County 1981].) The same considerations which persuaded a court to deny intervention by permission may come into play in denying a request for amicus status. (Id.) If the granting of amicus curiae status might delay the case, the court could deny the application in its discretion. (See e.g. Matter of Rourke v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., 159 Misc 2d 324, 327 [Sup Ct, NY County 1993]; State of New York v Philip Morris, Inc., 179 Misc 2d 435, 446 [Sup Ct, NY County 1998].)
Furthermore, the amicus curiae is “not a party, and cannot assume the functions of a party; he must accept the case before the court with issues made by the parties, and may not control the litigation.” (Kemp, 187 Misc at 709.) The court can set conditions on the granting of amicus status, such as limiting or denying oral argument, and even has the discretion, in an appropriate case, to allow the amicus to ask questions of a witness. (See Dawes v Silberman, 185 Misc 335 [Mun Ct, Queens County 1944], affd 185 Misc 338 [App Term, 2d Dept 1944].)
The Court of Appeals is the only court that has promulgated a rule specifying the standard for granting a motion for amicus curiae status. (22 NYCRR 500.11 [e].) The rule provides:
“A brief may be filed only by leave of court granted on motion, or upon the court’s own request. Motions for amicus curiae relief, when appropriately made on notice to all of the parties and sufficiently in advance of the argument of the appeal to allow adequate court review of the motion and the proposed brief, must include consideration of and satisfaction to the court of at least one of the following criteria:
“(1) a showing that the parties are not capable of a full and adequate presentation and that movants could remedy this deficiency;
“(2) that movants would invite the court’s attention to the law or arguments which might otherwise escape its consideration; or
“(3) that amicus curiae briefs would otherwise be of special assistance to the court.”
The Appellate Division, Second Department, has promulgated a rule which addresses the method for seeking amicus curiae status: “Permission to file an amicus curiae brief shall be obtained by persons who are not parties to the action or proceeding by motion on notice to each of the parties.” (22 NYCRR 670.11 [a].) The Second Department does not permit oral argument, unless ordered by the court. (22 NYCRR 670.11 [b].)
The Appellate Division, Fourth Department, rule provides that a person must “make a motion to serve and file a brief amicus curiae. An affidavit in support shall briefly set forth the issues to be briefed and the movant’s interest in the issues. The proposed brief may not duplicate arguments made by a party to the appeal or proceeding ... A person granted permission . . . shall not be entitled to oral argument.” (Rules of App Div, 4th Dept [22 NYCRR] § 1000.13 [k].)
After distilling the information contained in the rules promulgated by the appellate courts and trial court cases addressing amicus curiae, the court has considered the following criteria in evaluating the within orders to show cause for amicus curiae status:
(1) whether the movant seeking amicus curiae status moves by order to show cause; a motion by order to show cause seeking amicus is the preferable procedure as the trial court can then set an expeditious return date and procedure for providing notice by specifying how the parties are to be served, so as not to interfere with the main action;
(2) whether the affidavit/affirmation in support indicates the movant’s interest in the issues to be briefed and sets forth the issues, with a proposed brief attached;
(3) whether the affidavit/affirmation in support indicates:
(a) a showing that the parties are not capable of a full and adequate presentation and that movant could remedy this deficiency; or
(b) that movant would invite the court’s attention to the law or arguments which might otherwise escape its consideration; or
(c) that its amicus curiae brief would otherwise be of special assistance to the court; and
(4) whether the amicus curiae application or status would substantially prejudice the rights of the parties, including delaying the original action/proceeding; and
(5) whether the case concerns questions of important public interest.
Applying the above standard, the court finds that PENCIL and the Association of the Bar have made a sufficient showing for the court to sign the orders to show cause. The court will decide these applications and all other motions filed to intervene or for amicus curiae status in this case by submission without oral argument.
. By order to show cause, the petitioners-intervenors moved for an order inter alia: (1) scheduling an expedited hearing on the merits; (2) declaring that respondents’ reorganization plan is in violation of article 52-A of the Education Law, Civil Service Law §§ 17, 22, and 35 (g), and New York State Constitution, article V, § 6; (3) declaring that those portions of respondents’ reorganization plan that eliminate the position of community superintendent, district organizations, transfer or eliminate other district personnel, and close district offices be set aside, vacated, and declared null and void; (4) enjoining respondents from closing community school district offices and dismantling or transferring functions from community school district offices; (5) enjoining respondents from eliminating the position of community superintendents, and from transferring the duties of community superintendents to regional superintendents, local instructional supervisors, regional operations managers, or other authorities not within or under the jurisdiction of community districts; (6) directing respondents to select and appoint community superintendents for positions in all of the 32 community school districts by July 1, 2003; (7) enjoining respondents from eliminating other district personnel, including deputy superintendents, directors of operations, personnel directors, budget directors and such other personnel as may be necessary to effectuate school district operations; (8) enjoining respondents from consolidating committees on special education in the community school districts; (9) directing respondents to take remedial action to rescind any directives or instructions issued in furtherance of dismantling or closing such district offices, and terminating or transferring district personnel and community superintendents; and (10) directing respondents to restore budgetary authority to community school districts for the purposes of effectuating this order.
. The Appellate Division, Second Department, prescribes the length of the brief. (Rules of App Div, 2d Dept [22 NYCRR] § 670.11 [b].) The Appellate Division, First Department, rules permit briefs not in excess of 25 pages. (Rules of App Div, 1st Dept [22 NYCRR] § 600.10 [d] [1] [i].)

Memorandum.
Order unanimously reversed without costs, defendant’s motion granted to the extent it sought renewal, and, upon renewal, defendant’s motion for summary judgment granted and complaint dismissed.
Plaintiff was a passenger in a vehicle operated by defendant which was involved in an accident. At the time of the accident, defendant was a group home counselor employed by the Queensboro Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the vehicle was owned by Queensboro. Plaintiff was employed by a temporary employment agency known as “Tempositions” and had been assigned to work as a counselor at Queensboro’s Corona Group Home for at least six months prior to the accident. The accident occurred when the plaintiff and defendant were on their way to a picnic with three girls from the group home.
Defendant cross-moved for summary judgment on the ground that workers’ compensation was plaintiff’s exclusive remedy and, therefore, a bar to the instant action (Workers’ Compensation Law § 29 [6]). In support of the cross motion, defendant relied upon plaintiffs deposition testimony and upon the affidavit of Ms. Thrasher, the supervisor of Queensboro’s Corona Group Home. The cross motion was denied, the court finding itself unable to determine whether plaintiff was a special employee as a matter of law based upon the information submitted, and emphasizing that it gave little weight to Ms. Thrasher’s affidavit because, inter alia, it felt that the factual averments therein were insufficient. A deposition of Ms. Thrasher was subsequently held pursuant to a nonparty subpoena. Defendant then moved to renew and reargue the prior motion and submitted the deposition of Ms. Thrasher in support of the motion. The motion was denied, the court finding the motion to reargue to be untimely, and the motion to renew as, in effect, one to reargue, and, in any event, offering no new information which would change its prior determination.
A motion to renew is based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that could change the prior determination (or on a change in the law that would change the prior determination), and must contain a reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts in the prior motion (see CPLR 2221 [e] [2], [3]). The requirement that a motion for renewal be based upon newly discovered facts is a flexible one, and a court may, in its discretion, grant renewal even upon facts known to the movant at the time of the original motion (see Granato v Waldbaum’s, Inc., 289 AD2d 289 [2001]).
The deposition testimony of Ms. Thrasher, while perhaps not containing new facts, set them forth in a more detailed manner and was unavailable at the time that the original motion was made. Moreover, the deposition testimony was offered to persuade the court to reconsider issues that it had raised sua sponte in its original decision (see Scannell v Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., 256 AD2d 214 [1998]). Accordingly, the court below, in its discretion, should have considered the newly proffered evidence, and treated the motion as one to renew. Inasmuch as defendant offered a reasonable justification for failing to produce such evidence, the court below erred in denying renewal.
Turning to the merits of the underlying application, while it is true that Tempositions paid plaintiffs salary, the evidence submitted by defendant clearly demonstrated that Queensboro directly supervised and controlled the material aspects of plaintiffs work there. Plaintiff failed to show that Tempositions exercised any direction or control over her work at Queensboro. Although a person’s categorization as a special employee is usually a question of fact, this is not a per se rule. The determination of a worker’s special employment status “may be made as a matter of law where the particular, undisputed critical facts compel that conclusion and present no triable issue of fact” such as “where the undisputed facts establish that the general employer was performing no work for the special employee and did not retain control over the special employee” (Thompson v Grumman Aerospace Corp., 78 NY2d 553, 557-558 [1991]). Upon review of the record, we find that plaintiffs status as a special employee of Queensboro was established as a matter of law (see e.g. Niranjan v Airweld, Inc., 302 AD2d 572 [2003]; Carino v Kenmare Remodeling, 292 AD2d 555 [2002]; Lane v Fisher Park Lane Co., 276 AD2d 136 [2000]; Maldonado v Canac Intl., 258 AD2d 415 [1999]; Hanchett v Graphic Techniques, 243 AD2d 942 [1997]). Since receipt of compensation benefits from a general employer precludes an employee from commencing a negligence action against a special employer or coemployee (see Thompson v Grumman Aerospace Corp., supra; see also Martin v Baldwin Union Free School Dist., 271 AD2d 579 [2000]; Gubitosi v National Realty Co., 247 AD2d 512 [1998]), summary judgment should have been granted to defendant on its affirmative defense of workers’ compensation.

Louis B. York, J.
This is an order to show cause on a prejudgment motion, pursuant to CPLR 5229, compelling defendants to appear for examinations concerning the nature, extent and location of their assets, and restraining them from making or suffering any sale, assignment, transfer or interference with property in which they have an interest in, as if a restraining notice had been served upon them after judgment. This application was brought by plaintiff, Victoria Gallegos, the prevailing party in a jury trial against defendants Elite Model Management Corporation, John Casablancas, Gerald Marie, Mary Ann D’Angelico, and Monique Pillard.
Background
On April 25, 2003, after an eight-week bifurcated trial, a jury found all five defendants liable in damages to the plaintiff for violations of the New York City and New York State Human Rights Laws. The jury awarded plaintiff $2,673,590 in compensatory damages against all of the defendants and $2,600,000 in punitive damages against Elite. Shortly thereafter, defendants filed a motion to vacate the liability verdict and to vacate or substantially reduce the damages verdict pursuant to CPLR 4404; the motion is still pending before this court. Plaintiff filed this application pursuant to CPLR 5229, permitting examination of defendants and restraint of their assets. An order restraining defendants from transferring or selling any of their property was temporarily granted and thereafter extended pending the determination of this motion. For the reasons set forth below, the motion pursuant to CPLR 5229 is granted as to all defendants.
Discussion
CPLR 5229 provides,
“In any court, before a judgment is entered, upon motion of the party in whose favor a verdict or decision has been rendered, the trial judge may order examination of the adverse party and order him restrained with the same effect as if a restraining notice had been served upon him after judgment.”
The statute permits the postjudgment enforcement remedy of examination and restraint prior to the entry of a final judgment. (Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac 11 5229.01.) The only statutory requirement is that the application for CPLR 5229 relief be made by the prevailing party. (Sequa Capital Corp. v Nave, 921 F Supp 1072, 1076 [SD NY 1996].) It is in the trial court’s discretion whether to grant the injunctive relief in light of the purpose of the statute: to prevent an adverse party from disposing of assets in order to avoid judgment. (Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac IN 5229.01, 5229.04.) Research on application of the statute itself reveals little precedent; CPLR 5229 has been invoked in only a few cases to date, discussed below.
In Kaminsky v Kahn (46 Misc 2d 131, 132 [Sup Ct, NY County 1965]), the court granted CPLR 5229 relief, reasoning that regardless of the possibility of a reversal of the interlocutory judgment rendered against the adverse party, CPLR 5229 was justified where the adverse party was disposing certain of his assets by alleged gifts and sales. (Id. at 132.)
The main issue before the court in Unex Ltd. v Arsygrain (102 Misc 2d 810, 811 [NY County 1979]) was whether CPLR 5229 is available when the decision rendered is made by an arbitration panel. (Id. at 811.) The court relied on the legal canon of expressio unius in holding that CPLR 5229 relief is unavailable to the decision of an arbitration proceeding because the statute itself specifically states only the “trial judge” may order its relief. (Id. at 812.) On its facts, Unex is distinguishable to the facts of this case, primarily for the obvious reason that it involved an award rendered by an arbitration panel. That court stated, however, that even if CPLR 5229 relief was available to the movant, it would not have been granted because the prevailing party had not made a sufficient showing that the award may be rendered uncollectible because the adverse party was either in financial distress or danger existed that he would dissipate his assets in order to avoid a judgment. (Id. at 813.) Further, the Unex court suggested that CPLR 5229 relief may not be appropriate where decision on a posttrial motion vacating the verdict is reserved or if the trial judge believes a challenge to the verdict has merit. A potentially meritorious CPLR 4404 motion may lead to the denial of an application for examination and restraints primarily because the utility of obtaining such relief would seem questionable if it appears likely the verdict will not proceed to judgment. (Id. at 812.)
Finally, in Sequa v Nave (921 F Supp 1072 [SD NY 1996]) the court granted the prevailing party’s application for CPLR 5229 relief subsequent to granting its motion for summary judgment, holding that under the circumstances such relief was justified when the adverse party was shown to have transferred assets during the pendency of the motion and after it was granted. {Id. at 1074.) Citing Kaminsky, the Sequa court argued that in the event the danger exists that the adverse party will dispose of his assets prior to entry of judgment, granting CPLR 5229 relief is appropriate. {Id. at 1076.)
In the application before this court, plaintiff argues that no showing is required in order to obtain CPLR 5229 relief other than receiving a favorable verdict. Plaintiff contends CPLR 5229 relief is appropriate in this case and in line with the purpose of the statute because the danger exists that the defendants may be diverting assets to Elite’s overseas accounts and affiliates. Defendants vigorously oppose the application for examination and restraints on the grounds that the plaintiff has not satisfied the prerequisites to obtaining such relief, and there is a strong likelihood that the verdict will be vacated and will not proceed to judgment. Further, defendants claim that examinations regarding Elite’s assets are unnecessary because Elite’s director of accounting, Diann Perrotta, the person defined by defendants as the most knowledgeable about the company’s finances, has already been deposed regarding Elite’s financial condition and corporate assets. Defendants Pillard and Casablancas retained separate counsel subsequent to the trial and allege that they are being prejudiced by the conduct of their codefendants. As all defendants oppose the application before the court and were found by the jury to be jointly and severally liable, their arguments will be considered collectively.
In support of their motion for prejudgment examination and restraint, plaintiff submits excerpts from trial testimony and depositions of individual defendants, a former Elite employee, and Elite’s director of accounting. Plaintiff additionally submits documents referencing this testimony, highlighting numerous alleged inconsistencies and misrepresentations defendants have made regarding assets and relations with other Elite entities, particularly those located abroad. The totality of the adverse parties’ statements, submissions, and testimony, in addition to the Perrotta deposition and affidavit testimony, indicate that plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of CPLR 5229 because the court is led to believe the danger exists that defendants may dispose of or divert assets to avoid a potential judgment. As best as the court can discern the details of Elite’s financial structure and that of its affiliates, in addition to defendants’ interests therein, they are detailed below.
At trial, a former Elite employee Decorsey Folkes testified that a company directive was sent indicating that overseas bookings of Elite NY models were to be recorded as Elite SA. bookings, thus income generated from such transactions would go directly to Switzerland rather than Elite NY. (Record at 3515.) Defendants argue that Folkes’ statements cannot be given credence because he was not a booker who was responsible for invoicing model assignments and, further, he left the company on bad terms. (Perrotta affidavit at 7.) However, under direct and cross-examination, Folkes testified that he did, in fact, perform model bookings while employed at Elite. (Record at 3508, 3519.) Further, he testified that all bookings had to be entered into the computer, a task which he personally performed. (Record at 3521.) Mary Ann D’Angelico, Elite’s director of finance, when asked during cross-examination if an Elite NY model performs a job in Europe, whether the income generated is directed to Elite NY or one of Elite’s affiliates in Europe, stated such a booking would not be credited to Elite NY because “it wasn’t a New York transaction.” (Record at 3315.) Plaintiff alleges that the overseas booking procedure described above may be a diversion tool used by Elite to keep income off of Elite NY’s financial records.
Defendant Gerald Marie, the current president of Elite NY, gave inconsistent testimony at trial regarding the extent of his financial relationship with Elite S.A. and another Elite entity located in Switzerland, Elite Model Management Holding S.A. (Elite Holding). During cross-examination, Marie testified that, as of the date of his appearance on April 4, 2003, he was employed by Elite S.A. as a consultant. (Record at 1112.) In describing the extent of his relationship with Elite S.A., Marie stated that he was a shareholder, but did not occupy an executive position because Swiss law forbids a non-Swiss citizen to occupy an executive position in Switzerland. (Record at 1114-1115.)
Corroborating his trial testimony, Marie submitted the estimated net worth of his assets as of April 4, 2003, listing minority shares of Elite S.A. In response to a court order directing Marie to make a shareholder request of the financial statements of Elite S.A., a letter was submitted on Marie’s behalf by counsel for Elite S.A. The letter indicated that Marie is not a shareholder of Elite S.A., and thus has no right to access any of the company’s financials. (Letter from Bellanger to Goodman of May 2, 2003, record at 3178.) Another letter was submitted stating that Marie is not a direct shareholder of Elite S.A.; however, he is a “minority shareholder of one of the entities that in turn holds shares in another company that controls Elite S.A.” (Letter from Bellanger to Curtin of May 5, 2003, record at 3179.) At trial, plaintiff submitted a document from the Registre du Commerce de Fribourg (Registry of Commerce of Fribourg) listing Gerald Marie as the “director” of Elite Model Management Holding S.A. Marie’s actual title in Elite Holding remains unknown given the conflicting submissions: Bellanger indicated Marie was merely a minority shareholder, and the Commerce Registry located in Fribourg, Switzerland, recorded Marie as the director of Elite Holding. Neither does Marie mention owning shares of Elite Holding in his estimated net worth previously submitted to the court.
Diann Perrotta, Elite’s director of accounting, states in her affidavit in support of defendants’ opposition to plaintiffs application that she is “the most knowledgeable person in the company concerning matters relating to accounting, invoicing and payment to third parties.” (Perrotta affidavit at 2.) Unfortunately her deposition testimony does not illuminate the confusion referred to above. In her deposition, Perrotta is unable to name any shareholders of Elite S.A., though Elite S.A. is defined as Elite’s parent company. (Perrotta deposition at 81.) Perrotta further states that prior to its dissolution in 2001, Elite Holding’s shareholders were Elite S.A., followed by defendant Casablancas in 2000. (Perrotta deposition at 81-82.)
The court remains puzzled and frustrated by the gaps and inconsistencies that surfaced in response to plaintiff’s legitimate efforts to elicit Marie’s financials and relations to these other Elite entities. The questions surrounding Marie’s relationship with other Elite entities was not dislodged by Perrotta’s deposition, nor by defendants’ opposition papers to the present application, particularly in light of the absence of any posttrial sworn statements by Marie attesting to his true and accurate relationship with Elite S.A. and Elite Holding. As a result of defendants’ evasiveness and an apparent willingness to lead this court to erroneous conclusions, it appears this confusion is designed to prevent the financials of Elite S.A. from being disclosed in this litigation. Because the cloud of possible improprieties has not been lifted, the danger that defendants may divert or dispose of assets to avoid a judgment remains, which is precisely the reason the Legislature chose to promulgate legislation such as CPLR 5229. Justice Cuff has remarked,
“Legislation should be enacted which would automatically, on the rendering of a verdict by a jury or a decision by a court in actions at law, stay the loser from disposing of or transferring any of his property unless allowed to do so by his creditor’s consent or an order of court upon notice. The burden would then be where it belonged — on the one who owes the money.” (Zwerdling v Hamman Bldg. Corp., 145 Misc 471, 473-474 [Sup Ct, Kings County 1932]; Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac 1Í 5229.01.)
As for Elite’s former president, defendant John Casablancas, questions remain regarding how much he sold his share of Elite S.A. for in 2000. Casablancas and Marie were named as defendants in another lawsuit involving the sale of Casablancas’ holdings in Elite; the action was dismissed on the ground of forum non conveniens. (Buri v Casablancas, Kittler, Marie, Index No. 600954/99.) In its decision granting the motion to dismiss, Casablancas is alleged to have sold his share of Elite S.A. for $40 million. (Buri, slip op at 1.) During cross-examination Casablancas refutes this figure, claiming he sold his share for $5 million. (Record at 3222.) However, Casablancas also has chosen not to submit sworn posttrial statements or related documents supporting his trial testimony that his share of Elite S.A. was sold for the amount he stated and not the much greater amount alleged in the Buri case.
Additionally, though defendants’ counsel has stated in its opposition papers and in posttrial hearings that Elite is able to satisfy the judgment if entered, defendants’ counsel told the jury during opening statements that Elite was in terrible financial condition, a claim reiterated in the affirmation of Robert Goodman (Goodman affirmation at 4), and in Perrotta’s affidavit. (Perrotta affidavit at 2.) That an adverse party is in financial distress may be an issue for the court to consider in assessing the utility of CPLR 5229. (Unex, 102 Misc 2d at 813.)
In defendants’ opposition to the present application, they argue that in Kaminsky and Sequa, where CPLR 5229 was granted, it was undisputed that the adverse parties were disposing of assets in the form of sales and transfers. Neither these cases, the commentaries, nor the statute itself requires the prevailing party to submit evidence that assets are definitively being disposed of or diverted as a prerequisite to obtaining injunctive relief. Such evidence often may only surface on examination of the adverse party, ordered pursuant to CPLR 5229. A requirement of a showing that the adverse party has already disposed of assets runs counter to the purpose of CPLR 5229, which is a preventative measure designed to frustrate the adverse party from disposing of assets before such disposition takes place.
Further, defendants point out that because the court has reserved decision on a CPLR 4404 motion to vacate the verdict or substantially reduce the damages, Unex indicates this is sufficient to defeat plaintiffs application. Defendants argue that because it is likely the verdict will be vacated and will not “proceed in the normal course of events to judgment,” plaintiff s application necessarily fails. (Unex, 102 Misc 2d at 812.) That the court has reserved a CPLR 4404 motion to vacate the verdict does not require a denial of a CPLR 5229 application at this juncture. The Unex court suggests it is a factor the trial court should consider when employing its discretion as to the utility of granting CPLR 5229 relief. {Id. at 812.) Further, as the submission date for counsel’s briefs on the CPLR 4404 motion was set after the CPLR 5229 application was submitted and argued before the court, it is premature to decide whether the verdict will be vacated without first reviewing all the documents submitted by counsel in support of their respective positions. As the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, she is entitled to all the benefits available to the prevailing party in an action such as the guarantee the award is collectible, unless and until the verdict is not entered as a judgment.
Defendants’ concerns that granting plaintiffs application will render Elite without means to operate successfully and will jeopardize individual parties’ financial security and access to funds is unfounded. The restraints imposed by CPLR 5229 do not affect property that is not otherwise available to satisfy a money judgment, such as payment of salaries and living expenses that are ordinarily incurred.
Accordingly, it is ordered that the motion is granted and the examinations shall take place in accordance with plaintiff’s demand.

Respondent tenant Ehlich has moved for summary judgment dismissing this commercial nonpayment proceeding to recover possession of unit 3W at 112-114 West 14th Street, New York County. (CPLR 3212 [b].) Respondent alleges that the premises are an interim multiple dwelling (IMD) lacking a certificate of occupancy (CO) for residential use and in violation of the code compliance timetable for IMDs. (Multiple Dwelling Law §§ 281, 284 [1]; § 285 [1]; 29 RCNY 2-01 [c].) Absent a valid CO, petitioner landlords may neither collect rent nor prevail in a proceeding for possession based on nonpayment of rent until the legal defect is cured. (Multiple Dwelling Law § 302 [1] [b]; 468-470 Ninth Ave. Corp. v Randall, 199 AD2d 13 [1st Dept 1993]; Jalinos v Ramkalup, 255 AD2d 293, 294 [2d Dept 1998]; see Zane v Kellner, 240 AD2d 208, 209 [1st Dept 1997]; Hornfeld v Gaare, 130 AD2d 398, 400 [1st Dept 1987].) While an IMD may qualify for an exemption from this bar, absent the IMD’s legalization for residential use according to the statutory timetable, petitioners remain precluded from recovering rent or possession. (Multiple Dwelling Law § 284 [1]; § 285 [1]; 29 RCNY 2-01 [c]; County Dollar Corp. v Douglas, 161 AD2d 370, 371 [1st Dept 1990]; Goho Equities v Weiss, 149 Misc 2d 628, 630 [App Term, 1st Dept 1991]; Greeting Card Publs. v Spencer, 141 Misc 2d 800, 802 [Civ Ct, NY County 1988]; Cobra Resources v Dumpl, Inc., 138 Misc 2d 91, 94 [Civ Ct, NY County 1987].) Based on conflicting evidence, including respondent’s own affidavit, regarding whether he has in fact used the loft unit for residential purposes and petitioners have condoned that use, the court has denied respondent’s motion insofar as it seeks to dismiss the proceeding entirely. (Matter of Sara L., 249 AD2d 23 [1st Dept 1998]; Carlin v Crum & Forster Ins. Co., 191 AD2d 373 [1st Dept 1993]; King David Assoc. v Schonberger, 255 AD2d 423, 425 [2d Dept 1998]; see U.B.O. Realty Corp. v Mollica, 257 AD2d 460 [1st Dept 1999]; Metzendorf v 130 W. 57 Co., 132 AD2d 262, 265 [1st Dept 1987]; Ten Be Or Not Ten Be v Dibbs, NYLJ, June 12, 1985, at 11, col 4 [App Term, 1st Dept], affd 117 AD2d 1028 [1st Dept 1986].)
B. Petitioners’ Motion for Summary Judgment
Petitioners, on the other hand, have cross-moved for summary judgment, alleging that respondent’s unit has been used for commercial purposes since 1989, when, after evicting the residential occupants in 1988, petitioners filed an irrevocable restrictive covenant with the New York City Loft Board agreeing to maintain unit 3W as commercial for 15 years. (29 RCNY 2-08.1 [b] [formerly 2-08 (j) (2)].) In 1994, the Loft Board determined that petitioners were in compliance with the recorded covenant, and therefore unit 3W was not an IMD unit, based in part on an affidavit petitioners had procured from respondent that he was using the unit for commercial purposes.
In opposition, respondent relies on his current claim regarding the premises’ status. First, he acknowledges that in 1988, before he moved into his loft unit, petitioners purchased its residential fixtures from the outgoing tenant for fair market value. This purchase of IMD unit improvements would have removed the unit from rent regulation, but for respondent’s contention that the building housed at least five other residential units. (Multiple Dwelling Law § 286 [6].) He further contends that unit 3W continued to be used residentially until 1992, when he moved in. None of these allegations regarding occurrences predating respondent’s occupancy, however, is on personal knowledge. (Thomas v Our Lady of Mercy Med. Ctr., 289 AD2d 37, 38 [1st Dept 2001]; Perez v Brux Cab Corp., 251 AD2d 157, 159 [1st Dept 1998]; Lardaro v New York City Bldrs. Group, 271 AD2d 574, 576 [2d Dept 2000].)
Since 1992, in any event, respondent alleges that he has used unit 3W for residential purposes and petitioners have condoned that use, in violation of the recorded restrictive covenant filed with the Loft Board. (See, e.g., 182 Fifth Ave. v Design Dev. Concepts, 300 AD2d 198, 199 [1st Dept 2002]; Tracto Equip. Corp. v White, NYLJ, Mar. 21, 1997, at 36, col 4 [App Term, 2d Dept]; 315 Berry St. Corp. v Huang, NYLJ, Feb. 5, 2003, at 21, col 5 [Civ Ct, Kangs County].) He explains that petitioners, through fraud, duress, or undue influence, induced him to sign the 1994 affidavit of commercial use, by promising him subletting rights if he signed, threatening to make his tenancy miserable if he did not sign, and further promising never to use the affidavit against him. (Gibli v Kadosh, 279 AD2d 35, 38 [1st Dept 2000]; Polito v Polito, 121 AD2d 614, 615-616 [2d Dept 1986]; see Fruchthandler v Green, 233 AD2d 214 [1st Dept 1996]; Skluth v United Merchants & Mfrs., 163 AD2d 104, 106-107 [1st Dept 1990]; Dunn v Nissan Motor Co., 262 AD2d 444, 445 [2d Dept 1999]; Silver v Starrett, 176 Misc 2d 511, 515-516 [Sup Ct, NY County 1998].) To the extent respondent’s affidavit waived his claim of residential use under duress or through fraudulent inducement, it invalidates that waiver. (Gibli v Kadosh, 279 AD2d at 40-41; Bloss v Va’ad Harabonim of Riverdale, 203 AD2d 36, 37 [1st Dept 1994]; Mergler v Crystal Props. Assoc., 179 AD2d 177, 180 [1st Dept 1992].)
II. The Effect of Respondent’s 1994 Affidavit and the Loft Board’s 1994 Determination
A. Respondent’s Affidavit
Petitioners urge that respondent is estopped from taking a position inconsistent with his position in the 1994 Loft Board proceeding. Judicial estoppel precludes a party from making claims inconsistent with a position he successfully maintained in a prior adjudicatory proceeding. (Sandcham Realty Corp. v Taub, 292 AD2d 304, 305 [1st Dept 2002]; Secured Equities Invs. v McFarland, 300 AD2d 1137, 1138-1139 [4th Dept 2002].) The preclusive effect is the same whether the prior proceeding was administrative or judicial. (Matter of 67 Vestry Tenants Assn. v Raab, 172 Misc 2d 214, 219 [Sup Ct, NY County 1997]; see Inter-Power of N.Y. v Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 208 AD2d 1073, 1075 [3d Dept 1994]; Matter of Casella v Crosson, 178 AD2d 963 [4th Dept 1991]; Tozzi v Long Is. R.R. Co., 170 Misc 2d 606, 612-613 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1996].) Assuming the 1994 Loft Board proceeding was an adjudicatory proceeding to which this estoppel doctrine would apply, the flaw in petitioners’ argument is that respondent was not a party to and did not take a position in the 1994 proceeding. (Kalikow 78/79 Co. v State of New York, 174 AD2d 7, 11 [1st Dept 1992]; Abramovich v Harris, 227 AD2d 1000, 1001 [4th Dept 1996]; Hinman, Straub, Pigors & Manning v Broder, 124 AD2d 392, 394 [3d Dept 1986].)
Even if respondent is not estopped from relying on his current affidavits attesting to his residential use and to his excuse for attesting to the contrary in 1994, petitioners urge that the current affidavits are “obvious fabrications intended to overcome summary judgment.” (Carlin v Crum & Forster Ins. Co., 191 AD2d 373 [1993]; see Perez v Bronx Park S. Assoc., 285 AD2d 402, 404 [1st Dept 2001]; Phillips v Bronx Lebanon Hosp., 268 AD2d 318, 320 [1st Dept 2000]; Milton Weinstein Assoc. v NYNEX Corp., 266 AD2d 138, 139 [1st Dept 1999]; Hartman v Mountain Val. Brew Pub, 301 AD2d 570, 571 [2d Dept 2003].) While respondent’s prior acknowledged false statement is not to be minimized, the current affidavit of residential use petitioners claim to be a fabrication was not in desperate opposition to their summary judgment motion, but affirmatively put forth in support of respondent’s original motion. (E.g., Alvarez v New York City Hous. Auth., 295 AD2d 225, 226 [1st Dept 2002].) Second, respondent’s excuse for the prior contrary affidavit is plausible, not “obviously fabricated.” In fact nothing, other than that one contrary affidavit procured by petitioners, contradicts respondent’s evidence of residential use. (Matter of Sara L., 249 AD2d 23 [1998]; King David Assoc. v Schonberger, 255 AD2d at 425; see Milton Weinstein Assoc. v NYNEX Corp., 266 AD2d at 138-139.)
B. The Loft Board’s Determination
Finally, petitioners urge that this court may not undo the Loft Board’s administrative determination regarding the status of unit 3W at 112-114 West 14th Street. Petitioners claim this determination is both compelled by and equivalent to a zoning resolution prohibiting residential use. (See Wolinsky v Kee Yip Realty Corp., 302 AD2d 327 [1st Dept 2003]; Tan Holding Corp. v Wallace, 187 Misc 2d 687, 688-689 [App Term, 1st Dept 2001]; 315 Berry St. Corp. v Huang, NYLJ, Feb. 5, 2003, at 21, col 5.)
As to the first claim, a prohibition against residential use might apply, if, independent of such a prohibition, unit 3W does not qualify for protection under Multiple Dwelling Law §§ 281-286. (Wolinsky v Kee Yip Realty Corp., 302 AD2d 327 [2003].) A zoning resolution itself does not disqualify the unit, as Multiple Dwelling Law § 281 (4) provides that buildings or portions of buildings still may meet the definition of an IMD (Multiple Dwelling Law § 281 [2]), and be used for residential purposes even if a local zoning resolution prohibits residential use. (Tan Holding Corp. v Wallace, 187 Misc 2d at 689; Miller v Margab Realty, NYLJ, Apr. 11, 2001, at 19, col 2 [Sup Ct, NY County].) Consequently, according to petitioners’ own evidence, the City of New York, in litigation over section 281 (4), stipulated “not to enforce zoning provisions” that would prevent legalization of residential use (affidavit of Christian Green, exhibit H), and thus the only impediment to unit 3W’s residential use is “the duly recorded restrictive declaration” that respondent claims petitioners have ignored. {Id., exhibit J.)
As to petitioners’ second claim, it turns on “the distinction between ad hoc decision making based on individual facts and circumstances, and rulemaking, meaning ‘any kind of legislative or quasi-legislative norm or prescription which establishes a pattern or course of conduct for the future.’ ” (Matter of Alca Indus. v Delaney, 92 NY2d 775, 778 [1999] [citation omitted]; see Matter of DeJesus v Roberts, 296 AD2d 307, 310 [1st Dept 2002].) A zoning resolution, like the Loft Board’s own rules, “is a law of general applicability” (Matter of Sour Mtn. Realty v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, 260 AD2d 920, 923 [3d Dept 1999]); “a fixed, general principle to be applied . . . without regard to other facts and circumstances relevant to the regulatory scheme.” (Matter of Roman Catholic Diocese v New York State Dept. of Health, 66 NY2d 948, 951 [1985]; Matter of DeJesus v Roberts, 296 AD2d at 310; Matter of 439 E. 88 Owners Corp. v Tax Commn. of City of N.Y., NYLJ, Dec. 9, 2002, at 23, col 2 [Sup Ct, NY County]; 1700 York Assoc. v Kaskel, 182 Misc 2d 586, 593 [Civ Ct, NY County 1999].) While a zoning provision does not necessarily regulate the general public, zoning requirements are policies “invariably applied across-the-board” to the segment of the population within their ambit “without regard to individual circumstances or mitigating factors.” (Matter of Schwartfigure v Hartnett, 83 NY2d 296, 301 [1994]; see Matter of Cordero v Corbisiero, 80 NY2d 771, 772 [1992]; Matter of Singh v Taxi & Limousine Commn. of City of N.Y., 282 AD2d 368 [1st Dept 2001]; Matter of 439 E. 88 Owners Corp. v Tax Commn. of City of N.Y., NYLJ, Dec. 9, 2002, at 23, col 2; 1700 York Assoc. v Kaskel, 182 Misc 2d at 593-594.) Once formulated, a zoning resolution, a requirement of general applicability, applies uniformly to all buildings within the regulated zone, without further account of their characteristics. (Matter of Schwartfigure v Hartnett, 83 NY2d at 301; Matter of Sour Mtn. Realty v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, 260 AD2d at 923; Matter of 439 E. 88 Owners Corp. v Tax Commn. of City of N.Y., NYLJ, Dec. 9, 2002, at 23, col 2; 1700 York Assoc. v Kaskel, 182 Misc 2d at 594.)
The Loft Board’s determination that unit 3W was “not an IMD” based on circumstances individual to that unit, “that on September 9, 1989, the owner recorded with the City Registry an irrevocable covenant dated June 20, 1988” (Green affidavit, exhibit I) “is significantly different” from enacting a “legislative norm.” (Matter of Alca Indus. v Delaney, 92 NY2d at 778.) Dictating non-IMD status for unit 3W by reference to a particular owner’s past agreement is not a legislative prescription because the determination covers only that building and owner and does not establish a standard of conduct applicable to any other building or owner. (Id. at 778-779; Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v New York State Dept. of Labor, 88 NY2d 225, 229-230 [1996]; Matter of Williams v Smith, 72 NY2d 939, 940 [1988]; Matter of Roman Catholic Diocese v New York State Dept. of Health, 66 NY2d at 951.) A legislative enactment or rulemaking, by contrast, sets and implements a fixed, blanket standard or procedure that directs action to be taken in the future and hence may be determinative of future adjudications, “regardless of individual circumstances.” (Matter of Alca Indus. v Delaney, 92 NY2d at 778; see Matter of Cordero v Corbisiero, 80 NY2d at 772; Matter of Schwartfigure v Hartnett, 83 NY2d at 301; Matter of J.D. Posillico, Inc. v Department of Transp. of State of N.Y., 160 AD2d 1113, 1114 [3d Dept 1990]; 1700 York Assoc. v Kaskel, 182 Misc 2d at 593-594.)
In sum, neither any zoning requirement nor any Loft Board ruling prohibits respondent’s residential use of unit 3W. The Loft Board adjudication was based on and applicable to only petitioners’ version of the circumstances. Respondent’s version of the circumstances requires a new adjudication.
III. The Proper Adjudicatory Body
On April 24, 2003, respondent commenced a proceeding before the Loft Board to determine whether he is a protected residential tenant under Multiple Dwelling Law §§ 281-286. (29 RCNY 2-09 [b] [1].) He maintains he learned of the Loft Board’s 1994 determination only after petitioners commenced this eviction proceeding and hence too late to intervene, appeal, or request reconsideration. (CPLR 217; 29 RCNY 1-07 [b]; 1-07.1 [b].) Petitioners do not dispute respondent’s unawareness nor claim respondent consciously “opted out” of the 1994 proceeding brought by the landlord. (Matter of Marder v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal, 220 AD2d 204 [1st Dept 1995].)
A. Concurrent Jurisdiction
While the Loft Board may determine compliance with a restrictive covenant to maintain a unit as commercial and its consequent disqualification from IMD status, as the Board did in 1994, the court also may apply the covenant and governing rules and make these determinations. (29 RCNY 2-08.1 [b].) The court’s determinations need not await the Loft Board’s determinations of the issues. (County Dollar Corp. v Douglas, 161 AD2d at 371; Suraci v Mucktar, 187 Misc 2d 848, 850 [Civ Ct. NY County 2000].) “ ‘Unless the Legislature has expressed an explicit intention to vest exclusive original jurisdiction in the administrative agency,’ the court has concurrent jurisdiction.” (Id., quoting County Dollar Corp. v Douglas, 161 AD2d at 371.)
Yet once the Loft Board has made an administrative determination that a landlord has complied under the Loft Board rules, the court must defer to the Board’s sound discretion and lacks jurisdiction to make a compliance determination in the first instance. (29 RCNY 2-08.1 [b]; Matter of Perlrose Realty Corp. v New York City Loft Bd., 145 AD2d 159, 161 [1st Dept 1989]; Suraci v Mucktar, 187 Misc 2d at 850.) This deference, however, does not preclude the court’s determination when the Loft Board has not ruled on the issue. (Id.)
Here, the Loft Board has made an adjudicatory determination, but it does not bind respondent. Since he was not a party to the agency’s adjudicatory proceeding, that ruling does not preclude whatever defenses he may have to this eviction proceeding, where the landlord claims his unit is commercial and not an IMD unit based on compliance with the restrictive covenant. (Matter of Marder v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal, 220 AD2d 204 [1995]; Suraci v Mucktar, 187 Misc 2d at 850.) An obvious defense is that the landlord has not complied with the restriction against residential use. Having occupied the unit during the period when petitioners claim compliance, respondent has standing to dispute that claim and the consequences flowing from it. (See 19 W. 36th Holding Corp. v Parker, 193 Misc 2d 519, 523 [Civ Ct, NY County 2002].) Presented with this defense, the court may adjudicate whether the landlord has violated the restriction. (Suraci v Mucktar, 187 Misc 2d at 850.)
Adjudicating this claim requires application of the statutes and regulations governing lofts, but not Loft Board expertise to which judicial deference is necessary. The court in summary proceedings regularly adjudicates disputes involving interpretation of these laws and whether units are subject to them, as well as compliance with restrictive covenants. These questions, along with questions as to the collectible rent, may be determined by the Loft Board, but need not be. (Dundee Equity Corp. v Johnston, 103 AD2d 692, 693 [1st Dept 1984]; Haddad Corp. v Redmond Studio, 102 AD2d 730 [1st Dept 1984]; Baxter v Captain Crow Mgt., 128 Misc 2d 254, 261 [Sup Ct, NY County 1985]; see Axelrod v Duffin, 154 Misc 2d 310, 313-314 [App Term, 1st Dept 1992]; Baxter v Captain Crow Mgt., 128 Misc 2d at 263-264; Suraci v Mucktar, 187 Misc 2d at 851.)
B. Primary Jurisdiction
Although the court has concurrent jurisdiction over the issues pertaining to loft units presented here, it is to be exercised with an eye toward uniform evaluation of the relevant factors and avoidance of divergent determinations. (Davis v Waterside Hous. Co., 274 AD2d 318, 319 [1st Dept 2000]; Haddad Corp. v Redmond Studio, 102 AD2d 730 [1984]; Matter of Markow-Brown v Board of Educ. Port Jefferson Pub. Schools, 301 AD2d 653, 654 [2d Dept 2003]; Heller v Coca-Cola Co., 230 AD2d 768, 769-770 [2d Dept 1996].) Respondent may not use this proceeding to attack the Loft Board’s prior administrative decision. (19 W. 36th Holding Corp. v Parker, 193 Misc 2d at 523.) Particularly since he has commenced a new Loft Board proceeding, and only the Board may undo its prior determination, the goal of uniformity dictates that the agency be afforded the opportunity to achieve consistency in the administrative adjudications, even where the parties in the current administrative proceeding differ from the single party in the prior proceeding. (29 RCNY 1-09; Matter of Marder v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal, 220 AD2d 204 [1995].)
While the claim as to unit 3W’s status was originally cognizable in the court, the 1994 proceeding before the Loft Board placed resolution of the issue in the agency’s hands. (Matter of Markow-Brown v Board of Educ., 301 AD2d at 653-654; Heller v Coca-Cola Co., 230 AD2d at 769.) The agency may not have adjudicated the issue upon a full record and consideration of all concerned parties’ positions; nevertheless, the agency has considered the issue over the course of more than a decade. (Id. at 770.) Therefore the court accords the Loft Board primary administrative review, stays this eviction proceeding, and withholds its ultimate determination until resolution of the pending administrative proceeding. (29 RCNY 1-09; Davis v Waterside Hous. Co., 274 AD2d at 319; Eli Haddad Corp. v Redmond Studio, 102 AD2d 730 [1984]; Axelrod v Duffin, 154 Misc 2d at 314.)
IV Expedition of the Loft Board Proceeding
The duration of this stay and hence the delay in this proceeding is dependent on the duration of and any delay in the Loft Board proceeding. As a condition of the stay, respondent shall not delay the administrative proceeding, and to the extent the progress of the proceeding is in his control, he shall take all possible steps to expedite the proceeding.
Since the progress of this summary proceeding now depends on the Loft Board proceeding, for this proceeding to remain consistent with its objective, to provide a simple, short, quick, and efficient determination, the Loft Board proceeding must be expedited. (Suraci v Mucktar, 187 Misc 2d at 851.) Respondent’s precarious medical condition further dictates an expeditious resolution of his tenancy’s status and the claims by and against him. (Matter of Weinreb Mgt. v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal, 297 AD2d 221, 223 [1st Dept 2002].) Both sides are entitled to know, as quickly as possible, who is obligated to whom for unpaid or overpaid rent, so they may take steps to limit their future exposure. Thus, “without intruding on the prerogative of agency management,” this case warrants “a priority.” (Matter of Bloom v Division of Hous. & Community Renewal of State of N.Y., 138 Misc 2d 523, 529 [Sup Ct, NY County 1988].)
V Conclusion
Although this court ultimately might reach the same result as the 1994 Loft Board adjudication, it does not dictate that same result without consideration of respondent’s evidence, as well as any relevant factual developments since 1994, regarding the status of the premises respondent occupies. To avoid conflicting determinations, however, the court provides the agency an opportunity to revisit the issue in light of the new evidence. On the condition that the Loft Board conducts an expedited review of respondent’s pending application, the court defers to the agency’s primary jurisdiction and stays this proceeding, including determination of petitioners’ summary judgment motion, pending the administrative determination. Petitioners may move to lift the stay upon receiving that determination or upon a showing that the determination is unduly delayed. {Id. at 530.)

0272-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Louis C. Benza, J.
Plaintiffs move this court for a prehminary injunction enjoining defendants from issuing bonds or otherwise implementing the provisions of the MAC Refinancing Act. Defendants oppose such relief. After the submissions by the parties and oral argument held on August 14, 2003, the court makes the following determination.
In response to the fiscal crisis of the City of New York in the mid-1970s, the Legislature created the Municipal Assistance Corporation (hereinafter MAC) as a long-term refinancing vehicle for the City’s massive short-term debt. MAC bonds issued for this purpose were retired over the next 30 years and paid for with funds otherwise available to the City. The last MAC bonds were scheduled to become due in 2008. In early 2003, the City faced bond payments of $500 million per year for the five remaining years, and it became evident that, due to a difficult economic climate and budgetary pressures, the City needed assistance to ease this fiscal burden. In response, in May 2003, the Legislature passed the MAC Refinancing Act contained in part A4 of chapter 62 and part V of chapter 63 of the Laws of 2003. Passed over the Governor’s veto, the act amended the Public Authorities Law by adding a new section, section 3238-a, and amending section 3240. The purpose of the act was to replace the scheduled $2.5 billion in MAC payments over five years with 30 years of payments in the amount of $170 million per year until 2034. Plaintiff Local Government Assistance Corporation (hereinafter LGAC) was the entity charged with channeling the payments from a portion of the State’s sales tax.
Governed by Public Authorities Law § 3231 et seq., LGAC was established in 1990 as part of a fiscal reform program aimed at eliminating so-called “spring borrowing” (see, Matter of Schulz v State of New York, 151 Misc 2d 594, 599 [1992], mod 185 AD2d 596 [1992], appeal dismissed 81 NY2d 336 [1993]). It is authorized to issue bonds to provide funding to achieve its corporate purpose, including the making of payments to local governments, after such payments have been appropriated (see, Public Authorities Law § 3236 [1] [a]; § 3238). LGAC thereafter issued bond resolutions in 1990 and 2002. The State agreed that it would not impair the rights or remedies of bond or note-holders for obligations issued by LGAC (see, Public Authorities Law § 3241 [1]). However, although LGAC had the power to issue bonds and notes, the rights of holders remained subject to the provisions of the Public Authorities Law (see, Public Authorities Law § 3235 [9]).
LGAC is funded by the State’s sales tax revenue from the Local Government Tax Assistance Fund (see, Public Authorities Law § 3240 [3]; State Finance Law § 92-r). This fund is under the joint direction of the State Comptroller and State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, and LGAC receives one percent of the State’s sales tax to fund its obligations and expenses (see, State Finance Law § 92-r [1], [2]). To receive money from the fund, LGAC must certify to the Governor and Comptroller a schedule of cash requirements for the fiscal year equal to the amount of, inter alia, debt service due on its bonds (see, Public Authorities Law § 3240 [1]). The Comptroller is only authorized to make disbursements from the fund, however, if there has been an appropriation (see, State Finance Law § 92-r [5] [a]; Public Authorities Law § 3240 [3], [5]). Likewise, LGAC is authorized to make payments to local government from the monies it receives from the fund only after an appropriation for the amounts and the manner of payment (see, Public Authorities Law § 3239 [1] [a]; § 3238).
In promulgating the MAC Refinancing Act, through Public Authorities Law § 3238-a, the Legislature directed that, subject to State Finance Law § 92-r, LGAC pay to the City $170 million annually from its fund until 2034. Section 3238-a further provides that the Mayor of the City may assign any or all of these annual payments to a corporation under the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law, and contemplates that such corporation will issue bonds to the public. Defendant Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (hereinafter STARC) has been created for this purpose. On August 11, 2003, STARC distributed a preliminary offering relating to the proposed offering of $532,200,000 in bonds to mature in 2029.
On August 13, 2003, plaintiffs commenced this declaratory action seeking judgment declaring the act unconstitutional. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the act involves a multi-year obligation and violates NY Constitution article VII because the act neither subjected the annual $170 million payments to a referendum nor annual appropriation by the Legislature, and provides a gift or loan of the State’s credit (first, second and third causes of action); violates NY Constitution, article VIII, §§ 1 and 2 because the Mayor’s assignment of the City’s payments to STARC is a contracting of debt and without a pledge of full faith and credit (fourth and fifth causes of action); and violates US Constitution, article I, § 10 and NY Constitution, article I, § 6 because the 1991 and 2002 bond resolutions provide that LGAC’s contract with bondholders will have first claim to LGAC funds, and the act purports to impair this right by stating the City and its assignees have equal or superior rights to the funds (sixth and seventh causes of action). Plaintiffs thereafter brought the instant application for a preliminary injunction.
In support of their motion, plaintiffs contend that they have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits because the act is unconstitutional, that issuing the bonds could harm the State’s credit rating and cause irreparable harm, and that the equities balance in plaintiffs’ favor because neither defendants nor third parties will suffer any significant injury by delaying the issuance of the bonds.
Initially, a preliminary injunction is a drastic remedy and not routinely granted (see, Marietta Corp. v Fairhurst, 301 AD2d 734, 736 [2003]). In its discretion* this court must assess whether the moving party has demonstrated (1) a likelihood of ultimate success on the merits, (2) irreparable harm will occur should the injunction not be granted, and (3) that a balancing of the equities tip in the movant’s favor (see, Doe v Axelrod, 73 NY2d 748, 750 [1988]; Egan v New York Care Plus Ins. Co., 266 AD2d 600, 601 [1999]). In determining whether plaintiffs’ claim would ultimately be successful, the court is mindful that a party mounting a facial challenge to a statute must overcome the presumption of constitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt (see, Moran Towing Corp. v Urbach, 99 NY2d 443, 448 [2003]; LaValle v Hayden, 98 NY2d 155, 161 [2002]; Schulz v State of New York, 84 NY2d 231, 241 [1994]).
To begin, section 3238-a requires that payments to the City be made in accordance with State Finance Law § 92-r, which requires an appropriation prior to payment. Further, although the Legislature modified section 3240 (5), it left intact section 3240 (3), requiring payments to LGAC be appropriated. Given that the Legislature is presumed to create laws in harmony with those existing at the time of the new enactment, and reading all relevant statutory provisions together (see, Matter of Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v Department of Envtl. Conservation, 71 NY2d 186, 195 [1988]; McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 391), the court cannot say at this time that section 3240 (5) is in such irreconcilable conflict with sections 3238-a and 3240 (3) “that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid” (Moran Towing Corp. v Urbach, supra at 448, quoting United States v Salerno, 481 US 739, 745 [1987]). In making this determination, the court notes that the disputed language in section 3240 (5) could be interpreted to modify only the preceding sentence of that subdivision, relating to the ability of the State and LGAC to enter into agreements to modify payments. In that event, all subdivisions of section 3240 would harmonize, and section 3240 in its entirety would harmonize with the clear intent of the Legislature contained in section 3238-a, requiring that payments be subject to appropriation as set forth in State Finance Law § 92-r. Moreover, this interpretation is in keeping with section 3240 (4), and protects meddling by the State or LGAC after the money has been appropriated. This construction would avoid the absurd result of attributing to the Legislature the intent of enacting a statute that is facially unconstitutional, thus negating the very payments the Legislature sought to establish. As such, plaintiffs have not overcome the presumption of constitutionality, and demonstrated a likelihood of success on this issue.
Plaintiffs next contend that the assignment by the City to STARC of a stream of payments is an unconstitutional gift or loan by the City without full faith and credit. While section 3238-a does not specifically provide that the City is not indebted (compare Wein v City of New York, 36 NY2d 610, 618 [1975]), the language is nonetheless clear and the effect is the same. Section 3238-a simply provides that the Mayor may assign payments that are made in accordance with State Finance Law § 92-r. Said differently, the City may assign to STARC only what, if any, has been appropriated. The preliminary offering by STARC reflects this arrangement by advising investors that payments to LGAC are subject to appropriation, and that neither the payments to LGAC, or to STARC from LGAC, constitute a debt of the State or the City (affidavit of Robert S. Smith, dated Aug. 13, 2003, exhibit I). In reality, STARC is acting in the same capacity as LGAC, and to follow plaintiffs’ argument would in effect subject LGAC to the same constitutional impairment. As such, the court is unpersuaded that plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on this argument.
Plaintiffs’ final contention is that the act impinges upon pledges to LGAC’s bondholders by both the State pursuant to Public Authorities Law § 3241 (1) and LGAC through its “additional obligation clause” contained in its 1990 and 2002 bond resolutions. Plaintiffs contend that the act creates a new debt to be paid from the fund and the additional obligation clause of the bond resolutions is designed to protect depletion of funds for available debt service. Although Public Authorities Law § 3241 (1) recites that the State pledges not to alter the rights of LGAC to fulfill agreements or impair the rights of the bondholders (see id.), LGAC’s bondholders are aware that LGAC can only provide for the rights of bondholders subject to the provisions of the act (see Public Authorities Law § 3235 [9]). Additionally, it is worthy to note that plaintiffs cite no historical evidence that the fund has ever been insufficient to meet the obligations of LGAC; in fact, historically the fund has always had excess (affidavit of Mark Page H 42). In any event, the mechanism in Public Authorities Law § 3240 (3) and (4) allows for the Comptroller to take money from other income streams to pay LGAC’s debt service/expenses and meet deficiencies in the fund. Thus, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the rights of the bondholders are impaired. As such, the court determines that plaintiffs do not have a likelihood of success on this argument.
Accordingly, inasmuch as plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of ultimate success on the merits, they are not entitled to a preliminary injunction (see Welcher v Sobol, 222 AD2d 1001, 1003 [1995]).
Irreparable Harm and Balancing of Equities
Even if the court were to reach the issue of irreparable harm and balancing the equities, the result would be the same. Plaintiffs argue that irreparable harm is present because the City will float bonds pursuant to an illegal statute and this action damages the State’s credit rating. In light of this court’s initial determination that an appropriation is required, there can be no harm to the State’s credit rating or bondholders. Thus, plaintiffs have not established irreparable harm. Moreover, a balancing of the equities tips in defendants’ favor. Given the grave fiscal crisis facing the City, an inability to go forward with the bonds could result in the City’s financing coming under the control of a financial control board (see affidavit of Mark Page, dated Aug. 18, 2003, 1i 59).
As a final matter, the court notes that it is not the court’s function to create the public policy of the State. Rather, it is incumbent upon the judiciary to uphold the public policy as enacted by the Legislature (see Town of Mentz v County of Cayuga, 248 AD2d 1020 [1998]; Bordell v General Elec. Co., 208 AD2d 219, 221 [1995]). It is within these parameters that the court has rendered this determination.
Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.
. Spring borrowing developed because the State’s fiscal year ends in March and fiscal years for local governments end in June. Spring borrowing was the practice of local governments borrowing money in the last quarter of its fiscal year during the first quarter of the State’s fiscal year. This device distorted the State’s books by recording borrowing from the State’s next fiscal year to pay costs from the previous year’s costs. LGAC was authorized to issue long-term bonds to eliminate this practice.
. Section 3238-a provides, in relevant part: “Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, the corporation shall transfer to the City of New York [$170 million] from the resources of the corporation pursuant to section [3239] of this title. Such payment shall be made during each city fiscal year. Such payments from the corporation shall be made from the fund established by [State Finance Law § 92-r] and in accordance with the provisions thereof’ (emphasis added).
. Section 3240 (5) provides: “The agreement of the state contained in this section shall be deemed executory only to the extent of appropriations available for payments under this section and no liability on account of any such payment shall be incurred by the state beyond such appropriations. The state, acting through the director of the budget, and the corporation may enter into, amend, modify, or rescind one or more agreements providing for the specific manner, timing, and amount of payments to be made under this section, but only in conformity with this section. Provided however, this subdivision shall not apply for payments made pursuant to section [3238-a]” (emphasis added).
. Section 3240 (3) provides: “Upon receipt of such certification, or any revision thereof, the comptroller shall pay such amount to the corporation for payment or deposit in accordance with such certification, from the local government assistance tax fund established by section ninety-two-r of the state finance law or from any other amount appropriated for such purpose to the extent that moneys in such fund are insufficient for such purpose. Any such payment shall be made within thirty days of the receipt of the certification or at the time specified within the certification, whichever is later, provided that any such amounts shall have been first appropriated by the state” (emphasis added).",0
0690-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Thomas W Keegan, J.
Petitioners have commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of mandamus seeking to compel a determination of an application for a state pollution discharge ehmination system (hereinafter SPDES) permit, to compel public hearings on such permit application, and to compel a review of the underlying SPDES permit pursuant to the provisions of Environmental Conservation Law § 17-0817. The state respondents have moved to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the petition fails to state a claim. The Entergy respondents have moved to dismiss on the grounds that the petition fails to state a claim, that petitioners do not have standing, and of misjoinder of parties. It appears that a number of Entergy respondents were added by amended order to show cause. Such order has not been submitted to the court.
Preliminarily, the court grants the motion for admission of James C. Rehnquist, Esq., and Robert L. Brennan, Jr., Esq., to practice pro hac vice for the purpose of assisting in the defense of the above-entitled proceeding.
“Traditionally ‘[mjandamus lies to compel the performance of a purely ministerial act where there is a clear legal right to the relief sought’. The long established law is that ‘ “[wjhile a mandamus is an appropriate remedy to enforce the performance of a ministerial duty, it is well settled that it will not be awarded to compel an act in respect to which the officer may exercise judgment or discretion” ’ ” (Klostermann v Cuomo, 61 NY2d 525, 539 [1984] [citations omitted]). Petitioners do not seek to compel any specific result, which would constitute a discretionary act. Rather they seek to compel the state respondents to make some determination on the permit application, a proper subject of mandamus.
The instant proceeding involves claims of extreme delay in administrative action for which petitioners have no other available remedy. The proceeding arises out of applications for renewals of various SPDES permits for cooling water for several electricity generating plants on the lower Hudson River. This proceeding is limited to the SPDES permits for the two operating Indian Point nuclear power plants. These plants pump up to 2.4 billion gallons of water per day from the Hudson River. In doing so, large numbers of fish, at different stages of their life, are destroyed. It is claimed that billions of fish eggs, larvae and tiny fish have been killed by entrainment, that is, being pulled through the pumps and cooling system, over the past decade. In addition great numbers of larger fish have been killed by impingement, being caught on the intake system’s screens. The water is then discharged back into the Hudson River at significantly higher temperatures. This level of destruction has apparently been occurring since 1976, when Indian Point 3 came on line, adding to the withdrawals by Indian Point 2, which came on line in 1973. The record before the court does not indicate the level of withdrawals by Indian Point 1, which began operation in 1962 and was decommissioned in 1981.
A SPDES permit was originally issued for the plants in 1982. This permit was renewed in 1987, and by its terms, it expired in 1992. The then owners of the plants applied for a renewal in a timely fashion, resulting in the automatic extension of the permit pursuant to State Administrative Procedure Act § 401 (2). The state respondents have not acted upon the renewal application for in excess of a decade. Pursuant to ECL 17-0817 (1), SPDES permits, such as the one involved herein, shall be valid for a period not to exceed five years, less than half of the period of the automatic extension herein, and one third of the period of the 1987 permit, as extended. Indeed, one jurist has indicated that such an automatic extension cannot exceed the permit period of five years (see dissent in ONRC Action v Columbia Plywood, 286 F3d 1137, 1146 [2002]). It is clear that the failure of the state respondents to act on the permit renewal application has precluded the petitioners from obtaining any sort of judicial review of the de facto approval of the status quo due to the absence of any final reviewable determination. Respondents contend, in effect, that this situation can lawfully continue indefinitely, so long as the applicant and DEC agree to extend the time for a determination.
The first cause of action of the petition alleges that the state respondents were required to issue a determination on the permit renewal application within 90 days of the written notice that the application was complete, or from February 28, 2000, pursuant to ECL 70-0109 (3) (a) (i). Such subdivision provides “In the case of an application for a permit for which no public hearing has been held, such decision shall be mailed on or before ninety calendar days after the department mails written notice to the applicant that the application is complete . . . .” While a public hearing was in fact held on June 8, 2000, petitioners contend that it is not the type of hearing referenced in the statute.
Petitioners claim that the June 8, 2000 hearing was held pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8 [hereinafter SEQRA]), and not the Uniform Procedures Act (ECL art 70 [hereinafter UPA]). The regulations promulgated under the UPA at 6 NYCRR 621.7 (c) provide that the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) may determine to hold a legislative public hearing (after notice of completeness of the application) if there is a significant degree of public interest or to comply with 6 NYCRR 617.8, which governs SEQRA scoping hearings. The UPA therefore expressly authorizes a hearing which also serves a SEQRA purpose. Moreover, the scoping hearing is a preliminary hearing performed before a draft environmental impact statement (hereinafter DEIS) is even prepared. SEQRA regulations, at 6 NYCRR 617.9 (a) (4), provide for a public hearing on a DEIS based upon, inter alia, the degree of public interest. While such a hearing is not specifically enumerated in 6 NYCRR 621.7 (c), the standard for determining whether to hold a hearing is essentially the same for both types of hearing, and the hearings are both held at similar points in the administrative process. It is therefore determined that the hearing held on June 8, 2000 was one contemplated by ECL 70-0109. The court also finds that the fact that the hearing was held a few days beyond the 90-day requirement does not render the hearing a nullity. It is therefore determined that ECL 70-0109 (3) (a) (i) is inapplicable to the procedural history involved herein. As such, the first cause of action as pleaded fails to state a claim.
The second cause of action alleges that the state respondents are required by law to hold public hearings on the permit application and seeks a judgment directing such hearings. However, the determination as to whether to hold a public hearing is clearly discretionary and is itself subject to judicial review (see Matter of Industrial Liaison Comm. of Niagara Falls Chamber of Commerce v Flacke, 108 AD2d 1095 [1985]). It is therefore determined that the second cause of action fails to state a claim.
The third cause of action seeks to compel a review of the 1987 permit for conformance with new federal treatment technology, new state water quality classifications and water quality standards as required by ECL 17-0817 (3). Such subdivision requires review of all SPDES permits at least once every five years. Consideration of the entire section shows that many SPDES permits are issued for a period of 10 years. It further appears that the review required is to allow ranking of SPDES permits based upon the need for administrative attention (ECL 17-0817 [4]). The statute does not require any specific action on such review. The record before the court shows that the SPDES permit in question has been reviewed and ranked within the last five years. It further appears that the pending permit renewal application constitutes continuous review of the SPDES permit, thereby complying with ECL 17-0817 (3). It is therefore determined that the third cause of action also fails to state a claim.
The Court of Appeals in Campaign for Fiscal Equity v State of New York (86 NY2d 307, 318 [1995]) specifically addressed the standard to determine a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. It held that if the facts stated are sufficient to support any cognizable legal theory, the motion to dismiss should be denied. The Court in reviewing the complaint was not limited to the stated legal theory. This standard is applicable to article 78 proceedings as well (Matter of Northway 11 Communities v Town Bd. of Town of Malta, 300 AD2d 786 [3d Dept 2002]).
The court has already determined that the 90-day time period set forth in ECL 70-0109 (3) (a) (i) is inapplicable. There is also insufficient factual support in the petition to find that the DEC has received a complete record following the hearing, thereby commencing the 60-day period for determination pursuant to ECL 70-0109 (3) (a) (ii). However, there is still a general requirement that applications for permits or licenses be acted upon within a reasonable time (Matter of Utica Cheese v Barber, 49 NY2d 1028 [1980]). As indicated above, the renewal application has been pénding for more than 10 years, considerably longer than the delay of seven years characterized as extensive, unwarranted and prejudicial in Matter of Kupersmith v Public Health Council of State of N.Y. (101 AD2d 918 [1984], affd 63 NY2d 904 [1984]). There is no indication that the legislative history of the UPA evidences an intent that such requirement may be defeated by agreement of the applicant and the agency (see ECL 70-0109 [6]; 6 NYCRR 621.15 [a]), or that de facto extensions of the original terms of a SPDES permit be insulated from judicial review for periods grossly exceeding the legal term of such a permit.
It further appears that 6 NYCRR 621.5 (d) (7) requires that a notice of completeness of application include a tentative determination of the application with either a draft permit or a notice of intent to deny the permit. The notice of completeness issued herein did not include such a tentative determination, and respondents have used the absence of a draft permit as an excuse for even further delay. It thus appears that petitioners can state a claim for mandamus to compel a tentative determination as well.
With respect to the issue of standing raised by the Entergy respondents, petitioners have shown that they are regular recreational users of the Hudson River. They have also alleged that the state respondents’ failure to act on the permit application has allowed the destruction of billions of fish and aquatic organisms, thereby significantly degrading the quality of the river. It is therefore determined that petitioners have standing (see, Matter of Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach & Manhattan Beach v Planning Commn. of City of N.Y., 259 AD2d 26 [1999]).
The result is however different with respect to the Entergy respondents’ claim that petitioner Brodsky does not have capacity to sue in his official capacity (see Silver v Pataki, 96 NY2d 532 [2001]). Petitioner Brodsky contends that his vote has been nullified by the state respondents’ failure to comply with ECL 17-0817. It has already been determined that petitioners’ claims with respect to such statute fail to state a claim. Such claim therefore cannot support capacity to sue. Accordingly the Entergy respondents’ motion to dismiss is hereby granted with respect to petitioner Brodsky in his official capacity.
The Entergy respondents have also shown that Entergy Nuclear, Inc. and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. do not own the power plants and are not applicants for permit renewals. As such, they are not proper party respondents. Petitioners have failed to show any basis to continue the proceeding against said respondents. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss with respect to such respondents is also hereby granted.
The motions to dismiss the original petition for failure to state a claim are granted to the extent indicated herein.",0
0591-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Michael V Ajello, J.
Petitioners Robert Brodsky and Remy Bernardo instituted this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking, inter alia, to have them and one Denise Grant declared duly elected members of respondent Board of Managers of Dag Hammarskjold Tower Condominium and to compel the Board to hold a meeting of the unit owners for the purpose of conducting an election to fill the remaining six seats on said Board.
The election in question was held on June 24, 2003. For many years prior thereto, no election for Board members had been held at the annual meeting of the stockholders, evidently due to the failure to have a quorum present. It appears that none of the members serving on the Board prior to the June 24 meeting had been elected but had become members by a vote of the other members of the Board, pursuant to section 2.9 of the bylaws of the condominium.
The condominium was created as an unincorporated association pursuant to article 9-B of the Real Property Law (the Condominium Act) and has between 235 and 250 units (different figures were given by petitioner and respondents). Most of the units are owned by individuals but approximately 51 units are owned by corporations and foreign governments.
By notice dated December 20, 2002, the Board notified the unit owners that the cooling tower had to be replaced at a cost of approximately $600,000, major facade work was required at a cost of between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000, and that the Board had unanimously voted to levy a special assessment of $975,000 to be paid by all unit owners based on their share of percentage of common interest. The special assessment was due on January 15, 2003. The unit owners were further advised that effective February 1, 2003 all common charges would be increased by 20% and that the Board expected an additional special assessment for 2003 which was anticipated to be “somewhat higher” than the assessment due January 15, 2003.
Following receipt of notice of the assessment, a number of unit owners formed the Concerned Homeowners Group of the Dag Hammarskjold Tower Condominium and retained attorneys, who wrote the condominium’s attorney requesting that an annual meeting be called to conduct an election for the entire nine members of the Board. The Board refused to conduct an election for nine members but served notice that a meeting would be held for the election of three members to fill the positions occupied by Phyliss Elstein, the Board president, George Avras, the vice-president, and Kathleen Garrett, alleging that under the staggered term provisions of the bylaws, those were the three positions scheduled for election in 2003.
The Concerned Homeowners formed a slate of three candidates (hereinafter Pro Slate) made up of petitioners and Denise Grant and solicited proxies for the Pro Slate. Two employees of the condominium’s managing agent and an associate of petitioner’s attorneys were appointed by the Board to serve as inspectors of election. The inspectors disallowed a number of Pro Slate proxies but nevertheless announced that a quorum had been achieved based on the attendance by unit owners either in person or by proxies which had been validated by the inspectors.
The following morning the inspectors met to tally the votes and determined that the Pro Slate had been elected. (Also voted on at the meeting were proposals to reduce the number of unit owners required to consent to borrow money and consent to borrow up to $1,000,000 for the facade project. These proposals were not approved by the unit owners.) Respondents Phyliss Elstein and George Avras observed the vote tally and objected to the validation by the inspectors of a number of Pro Slate proxies because the signatures of the unit owners had been acknowledged by a notary who was also a Pro Slate candidate.
On July 5, 2003, Denise Grant received an e-mail from Janet Roman, the account executive assigned to the condominium by the managing agent, informing her that on June 30, 2003 the Board had retained special counsel to review the entire election. Subsequent thereto, on July 11, 2003, petitioners’ attorneys received a letter from the special counsel-retained by the Board in which he stated that it appeared that there were an insufficient number of unit owners present at the meeting either in person or by proxy to have properly conducted the election. This conclusion was based on Pro Slate proxies for 61 units representing approximately 16.37% of the common interest being notarized by candidate Bernardo, and suspect notarizations on seven units representing approximately three percent of the common interest (it was later alleged that the suspect notarizations actually involved at least four proxies wherein the persons whose signatures had been acknowledged did not personally appear before the notary).
The letter from special counsel further indicated that the proxies submitted by entity unit owners of seven additional units contained, defects in attorney opinion letters, corporate resolutions and certifications. (In 1997 the Board adopted a resolution requiring that signatures on all proxies of individuals be acknowledged and the proxies of all corporations or other entities must be accompanied by an acknowledgment of the signature of the designor of the proxy; an opinion rendered by a New York attorney that the entity was duly organized and in good standing; the identity of all directors, managers or officers of the entity and a certified copy of the resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of the entity authorizing the proxy. The resolution indicated that proxies had been submitted bearing designors’ signatures which appeared not to be authentic and it served the interests of the condominium to ensure that all proxies be properly designated by authentic signatures of designors.)
This article 78 proceeding was instituted following the refusal to recognize petitioners and Denise Grant as duly elected members of the Board.
I find that a quorum was present at the annual meeting and that all of the proxies with allegedly faulty acknowledgments were properly counted since acknowledgments were not required.
As a general rule, absent some statutory or bylaw provision, no special form is required for a proxy (Prince v Albin, 23 Misc 2d 194 [1960]). The issue we are confronted with is whether a board may require that a proxy be acknowledged when such a requirement is not contained in the bylaws. There appears to be only one case touching on that issue. In West v Board of Directors of Seward Park Hous. Corp. (Sup Ct, NY County, June 14, 2000, Miller, J., Index No. 602319/00), plaintiff challenged the entire proxy procedure to be used in an upcoming election for three directors. One of the requirements which the board had put into effect was notarization of any proxy that was mailed back to the honest ballot association, which was to supervise the election, prior to the election or submitted by one other than the signatory shareholder. It was alleged, as it is in the case at bar, that the motivation for requiring notarization was to insure the integrity of the voting process. Justice Miller evidently found no impediment to the board requiring notarization of the proxies.
Although respondents strongly rely on the West decision, I find it to be distinguishable from the case at bar. In West, the bylaws were completely silent as to voting by proxy. It has been held that in the absence of express regulation or bylaw, conduct of meetings or elections is controlled by fundamental usage, common practice and the general rule that all who are entitled to take part shall be treated with fairness and good faith (Young v Jebbett, 213 App Div 774 [1925]; Jordan v Allegany Co-op Ins. Co., 147 Misc 2d 768 [1990]). (It should be noted that in respondents’ supplemental memorandum of law it is claimed that in a subsequent action related to the West case, Justice Marilyn Shafer reiterated and confirmed the board’s authority to require notarization of proxies by stating that a “Mousing [corporation could require that proxies be notarized.” [Seward Park Hous. Corp. v Honest Ballot Assn., Sup Ct, NY County, Nov. 30, 2001, Index No. 122656/00.] Actually, Justice Shafer merely stated that the “Business Corporation Law does not require notarization of proxies but Justice L. Miller ruled that the Housing Corporation could require that the proxies be notarized.”)
In this matter, proxies are specifically covered in the bylaws. Section 4.8 (D) provides in part as follows:
“The owner(s) of any Unit may designate any Person to act as a proxy on his or her behalf. The designation of any such proxy shall be made in a writing both signed and dated by the designor and delivered to the Secretary of the Condominium at or before the appointed time for the meeting(s) during which the same is to be effective.”
This general proxy provision is made specifically applicable to elections of members of the Board (bylaws § 4.9 [A]).
Inasmuch as the bylaws specifically cover proxies and, as to form, require only that they be in writing, signed and dated, I find that a further requirement that they be acknowledged can be accomplished only by an amendment of the bylaws, requiring a vote of the unit owners representing not less than 662/3% in number and common interest (Real Property Law § 339-v [1] []']; bylaws § 12.1 [A]). The Board was therefore without authority to pass the resolution requiring an acknowledgment of all proxies and any alleged defect concerning the acknowledgment would be irrelevant. In so holding, I do not pass on the intent of the Board in adopting the resolution. Inasmuch as all the proxies with alleged improper notarizations were valid, a quorum was present at the meeting.
Even if the Board could require that all proxies be acknowledged, I would still find that there was a quorum present and that petitioners were duly elected as members of the Board.
It has generally been held that an acknowledgment before a party to the instrument is a nullity (Armstrong v Combs, 15 App Div 246 [1897]; People ex rel. Erie R.R. Co. v Board of R.R. Commrs., 105 App Div 273 [1905]; 1 NY Jur 2d, Acknowledgments § 11). Stated more broadly, a notary may not act in a matter where he or she is a party or is directly and pecuniarily interested in the transaction (Sumkin v Hammonds, 177 Misc 2d 1006 [1998]).
A different rule has been applied to cases governed by the Election Law. In Matter of Bulger (48 Misc 584 [1905]), certificates of nomination were acknowledged before notaries who were candidates for office. The court sustained the certificates, holding that the candidate did not sign the instrument and was not an interested party or a party to the instrument as in the case of a conveyance of real estate (see also, Kerns v Whiting, 187 Misc 656 [1946]; Matter of Bassett, 108 Misc 461 [1919]).
Of course, the cases decided under the Election Law can be distinguished because the Election Law should be liberally construed. Nevertheless, the reasoning used in cases such as Matter of Bulger should be applied to the case at bar. Petitioner Remy Bernardo, who was the notary taking the acknowledgment of the persons executing the proxies, did not sign the instruments and was not a party thereto. Nor can it be said that he is directly and pecuniarily interested in the transaction. At most, there would be only a technical defect, which may be ignored (see e.g. Timmerman v Board of Mgrs. of Anchorage Condominium, 212 AD2d 523 [1995]). A case in point is Seward Park Hous. Corp. v Honest Ballot Assn. (supra), where a number of votes at an election for members of the board of directors were cast by proxies in which the person appointed as agent to vote for the shareholders also acted as the notary. Therefore, the notary was actually a party to the instrument. The court refused to set aside.the election based on what, at worst, was a technical violation, and there was no evidence of actual fraud.
I therefore find that there is no basis for invalidating the proxies acknowledged by Remy Bernardo and that a quorum was present at the June 24, 2003 meeting.
Seward Park Hous. Corp. v Honest Ballot Assn. (287 AD2d 266 [2001]) does not require a different result. The Court there stated that the notarization of ballots of cooperative shareholders by their proxy holder, not a candidate himself but an active backer of one of the competing slates, is not a reason, per se, to void the ballots. It is sufficient to note that the case involved notarization of ballots and not of proxies and invalidation of a ballot may very well be required where the candidate, the person casting the ballot, and the notary are one and the same.
Insofar as the election of the remaining six members of the Board is concerned, section 2.9 of the bylaws provides that a vacancy will be filled by a vote of a majority of the remaining members and each person so elected will be a member of the Board for the remainder of the term of the member being replaced, “or until a successor will be elected at the next annual meeting of the Unit Owners.” This can only be construed to mean that any Board member who is elected by the Board to fill a vacancy for a member whose term has already expired shall serve only until a replacement is elected at the next meeting.
In view of the many years that have elapsed since the last time an election was held for members of the Board (prior to the June 24, 2003 election), it is evident that none of the six members was serving the remainder of a term to which he or she was elected by the unit owners, nor is anyone presently serving the remainder of a term of a member whom he or she replaced. Consequently, all six positions should have come up for election at the June 24 meeting.
Respondents’ argument that the application seeking an order directing a meeting to elect six members of the Board is time-barred is without merit. While the six seats are held by persons who have been Board members for more than four months, all the seats should have come up for election at the last meeting, and the article 78 proceeding was instituted less than four months after that meeting was held.
It is required by section 339-v (1) (a) of the Real Property Law that the bylaws of a condominium shall provide that the terms of at least one third of the members of the Board shall expire annually, and such a provision is contained in section 2.7 of the bylaws. Inasmuch as at the annual meeting held on June 24, 2003 three members were elected for a term of three years which will expire in 2006, three of the Board members must be elected for a term that will expire at the time of the annual meeting to be held in 2005 and three for a term to expire at the time of the annual meeting to be held in 2004. The three members receiving the highest votes shall serve until 2005 and the remaining three members shall serve until 2004. At all subsequent annual meetings of the unit owners commencing with the meeting in 2004, three members shall be elected to serve a term of office fixed at three years.
The petition must be denied and the proceeding dismissed as to respondents Brown Harris Stevens, Janet Roman, and John and Jane Doe since no relief was requested as to these respondents.",0

Memorandum.
Final judgment affirmed without costs.
In this holdover proceeding to recover possession of a rent-stabilized apartment based on an alleged occupancy by respondent as a nonprimary residence, it is our opinion that the proceeding, as noted by the trial court, is premature. Respondent, who has a large family of 10, including an autistic daughter, occupied unit IB, the subject premises. She was forced to vacate the apartment as a result of a vacate order by the Department of Buildings following a fire in the premises. Since respondent and her 10 relatives were unable to find suitable temporary housing, they spent three months in a shelter. In order to resolve her housing situation, respondent purchased a one-family home in the area under Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines. Approval of the mortgage was conditioned upon her agreeing to occupy the premises as her primary residence for one year. Inasmuch as the deed was conveyed on April 11, 2001, respondent was required to maintain said premises as her primary residence through April 10, 2002. Respondent stated that her intention was to return to the instant apartment, unit IB, with her autistic daughter once it is habitable and allow the other family members occupancy of the house. Respondent’s temporary relocation to another dwelling place does not, by itself, under the circumstances herein,, establish that the premises is not her primary residence (cf. Pape v Doar, NYLJ, May 31, 1989, at 21, col 4 [App Term, 1st Dept], affd 160 AD2d 213 [1990]). Similarly, respondent’s declaration that the HUD-assisted home would be her primary residence for one year does not, contrary to the dissent’s view, in these circumstances, require a finding of nonprimary residence (see Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] § 2520.6 [u] [1]; Glenbriar Co. v Lipsman, 2002 NY Slip Op 50225[U] [App Term, 1st Dept]; Rego Estates v Lillian, NYLJ, June 23, 1998, at 33, col 3 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists]). Since, as the trial court noted, the subject apartment was not yet habitable, the instant proceeding is premature.
Golia, J., dissents and votes to reverse the final judgment and award final judgment in favor of petitioners in the following memorandum: In this matter now under review, the trial court dismissed the proceeding as premature and my colleagues on this court have voted to affirm that holding. I, however, respectfully dissent.
Rosa Benitez, the respondent herein, was a “rent-stabilized” tenant in the subject apartment building on February 28, 2001, when the building became uninhabitable as the result of a fire. Ms. Benitez was therefore compelled to involuntarily vacate the premises. She soon thereafter made application to the Office of Rent Administration of the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to have the “legal regulated rent” for her apartment reduced as a result of the subject apartment being rendered uninhabitable.
On June 5, 2001, the Office of Rent Administration of the DHCR issued an order in which it stated that “After consideration of all the evidence . . . [establishes . . . that the rent on February 28, 2001 was $1.00 per month.” Said order goes on to provide that “This Order entitles the tenant upon payment of the $1.00 per month to be restored to occupancy of the subject apartment” (emphasis added).
It is important to note that the order provided that “the tenant” shall be “restored to occupancy.” The importance of this provision is that the order recognized that Ms. Benitez remained a rent-stabilized “tenant” even though she could not, at that time, “occupy” the subject apartment. There is nothing contained in that order or anywhere else in the Rent Stabilization Code that changes or abrogates the requirement that rent protection only applies if the subject premises remains as “your primary residence.”
On or about April 11, 2001, Ms. Benitez purchased a private, single-family house. The mortgage used to purchase that house was obtained through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program, under the auspices of the federal government. One of the requirements for qualifying to receive the benefit of a HUD “backed” mortgage was that the purchaser (Ms. Benitez) had to sign a paper and acknowledge that she would occupy the house as her primary residence for no less than one year. Consequently, at the moment Ms. Benitez took title on her private house, she was assuring an agency of the federal government that the house she was purchasing via the HUD mortgage loan was her primary residence and would remain so for no less than one year. At the same time, she was taking advantage of the benefits provided by the State and City of New York under the Rent Stabilization Code predicated upon her assurance that the subject apartment was her primary residence.
There is a clear and irreconcilable conflict between simultaneously asserting that your newly purchased private house is your primary residence (to obtain HUD benefits) and that your rent-stabilized apartment is your primary residence (to obtain benefits under the Rent Stabilization Code).
Both my colleagues on this court and the judge of the lower court have reconciled Ms. Benitez’ duplicitous actions by arguing that her statements do not become inconsistent until her uninhabitable apartment is again ready for occupancy. Accordingly, this proceeding by the owner is premature and should be dismissed without prejudice to renew.
Ms. Benitez has lost the use of her apartment as the result of a fire through no fault of her own. Consequently, I agree with the actions of the DHCR in providing a rent adjustment to $1 per month to assure that Ms. Benitez will be restored to occupancy as soon as the apartment is repaired. However, when Ms. Benitez chose to purchase a private home and take advantage of the special and unique benefits of a federally subsidized mortgage program, and further, chose to make conflicting assurances about her primary residence to take advantage of the federal, state and city laws, a conflict arose. No one can, at the exact same time, have more than one primary residence.
To fully appreciate the impact of her actions, one must understand the benefits and obligations provided by the Rent Stabilization Code. The code provides the maximum rent a landlord can charge for lease renewals, restricts the ability of a landlord to evict a tenant during the term of the lease, and even the ability of a landlord to elect not to renew the lease with that particular tenant. The code further provides for harsh punishment against a landlord that violates the code including treble damages, rent abatements, rent reductions, etc. However, in order to take advantage of all these protections, the tenant must maintain the subject apartment as his or her primary residence, pay the rent as established and not create a “nuisance.”
By making a rental payment of $1 per month, Ms. Benitez was retaining all of her rights and not simply paying for a right of “first refusal” when the apartment became available for use. Indeed, she would be entitled to reenter at the stabilized rent applicable and not have to pay a higher “vacancy” rent that would be charged to every other person in the world but her. Clearly, the reason being is that she remained a statutory tenant, but only if she met all obligations of the code. One of those obligations was maintaining the apartment as her primary residence.
Although the term “primary residence” is generally regarded in terms of the physical occupancy of a particular apartment, there is a myriad of other facts and circumstances to consider when determining what constitutes a primary residence. Intent is certainly an important consideration. Many other considerations are codified in 28 RCNY 3-02 (m) (4) and addressed in Matter of Alfred v Barrios-Paoli (251 AD2d 659 [1998]). These include the address used for tax purposes, registering motor vehicles, voting, the time spent residing in the premises, etc.
However, during the period of time she retained her tenancy, she filed an intent to purchase a house to be used as her primary residence with the HUD program. By doing so, she acknowledges by her actions, words and deeds, her willingness to forgo her intent to treat the subject apartment as her primary residence. Ms. Benitez had a myriad of choices and opportunities that she could have elected to take which would not have disqualified her from retaining her rights to the subject premises under the Rent Stabilization Code. Indeed, she could have purchased the same home without the benefit of a “HUD” mortgage which required the election that she take the property as her primary residence. Conceivably, she could have even moved out of the State of New York and still retained the subject apartment as her primary residence. The thing she could not do was to elect to take another residence as her primary residence, and that is precisely what she did do.
Contrary to the finding of the majority, habitability and occupancy is not the issue. It was used as a chimera whose glint has momentarily distracted my colleagues from the willful and conflicting intent of Ms. Benitez.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and vote to reverse the holding of the lower court and award a final judgment of possession in favor of the petitioners.

Alice Schlesinger, J.
Before the court are two CPLR article 78 proceedings consolidated herein for disposition: McFarlane v New York City Hous. Auth. (NYCHA) (Index No. 119226/02) and Hayes v Hernandez (Index No. 400105/03). The proceedings involve the same issue in virtually identical contexts, namely, whether NYCHA’s denial of petitioner’s request for remaining family member status was arbitrary and capricious in that it was based solely on the rigid application of the policy requiring tenants to obtain written consent before adding family members to the household, without regard to the significant mitigating circumstances and relevant facts of each individual case. The issue is of particular significance in light of the July 31, 2003 holding by the Appellate Division, First Department, that the written consent requirement is a valid policy which accommodates federal law. (Matter of Abdil v Martinez, 307 AD2d 238 [2003].) However, for the reasons discussed below, the Abdil decision does not preclude this court’s finding in favor of the petitioners herein, but instead supports it.
The Administrative Proceedings
In both proceedings, the petitioners seek to annul a decision by NYCHA Hearing Officer Joan Parnell denying them “remaining family member” status. The petitioners both assert, on various grounds, that they are entitled to leases in their own names because they co-occupied respective NYCHA apartments with the tenant of record as a member of the tenant’s family and remained in occupancy continuously up to and including the time the tenant died. The relevant facts are set forth in the decisions of the hearing officer, and also in the transcripts of the administrative proceedings and the evidence adduced at the hearings. They are summarized herein.
Marco McFarlane was born on August 1, 1978. In 1994, at age 16, he moved in with his grandmother Catherine Keeles in a building operated by NYCHA. Ms. Keeles was a long-term NYCHA tenant, having commenced her occupancy in 1953 with her husband who had predeceased her. Before Mr. McFarlane moved into the apartment, his Uncle Leroy had shared the apartment with Ms. Keeles. When his uncle left, Mr. McFarlane moved in.
The evidence adduced at the hearing established that Ms. Keeles was critically ill and barely able to walk when Mr. Mc-Farlane moved in, having suffered from several heart attacks and surgery. Although she had a health care worker on a part-time basis, Ms. Keeles needed additional assistance which Mr. McFarlane provided until his grandmother died on September 1, 2000. Shortly thereafter, Mr. McFarlane went to the NYCHA management office to advise them that his grandmother had passed away and to confirm whether the September rent had been paid. Management advised Mr. McFarlane that he could not remain in the apartment unless he proved his status as a remaining family member.
In accordance with the instructions given him, Mr. McFarlane followed the procedures to obtain a grievance hearing in an attempt to establish his status as a remaining family member. He appeared, representing himself at the hearing on April 11, 2002. Through his testimony and a variety of documents which he had collected, Mr. McFarlane established that he had been co-occupying the apartment with his grandmother for a number of years, having commenced his occupancy while in high school, that he had since graduated from high school and was over 18 years old, that he had been employed for a little over a year following his grandmother’s death with annual earnings of approximately $12,700, and that he was a person of good character known to and respected by other members of the tenant community where he lived. Thus, the self-represented Mr. McFarlane had successfully proven two of the three points which the hearing officer had advised him were necessary to establish his status as a remaining family member; that is, that he had moved into the apartment with his grandmother and that he had lived there with her continuously, up to and including the time she died.
The third point which Mr. McFarlane was instructed to prove was whether his grandmother Catherine Keeles had obtained the written consent of NYCHA for Mr. McFarlane’s occupancy. When the housing assistant testified that NYCHA records did not include any such written consent, Mr. McFarlane responded by explaining as follows: “She wasn’t able to walk around her last years of life, so she couldn’t really get to the rent office, and her death was sudden. It’s a lot of reasons why I’m not on there, but hey, there’s not much I could really say about it.”
Mr. McFarlane’s testimony was circumstantially confirmed, by the fact that Ms. Keeles had previously requested, and been granted, consent for other family members to reside with her. Those family members had included other grandchildren and Mr. McFarlane’s Uncle Leroy whose occupancy Mr. McFarlane replaced. It is reasonable to infer from the evidence, which included proof of McFarlane’s occupancy, his good character, and his grandmother’s poor health, that Ms. Keeles did not request consent for the young McFarlane’s occupancy simply because she had not been readily able to do so. Presumably, consent would have been granted had it been requested. (See, Via v Franco, 223 AD2d 479 [1st Dept 1996] [error for NYCHA to deny consent for tenant’s family member to join the household].)
By decision dated May 8, 2002, NYCHA Hearing Officer Joan Parnell denied Mr. McFarlane’s request for a lease as a remaining family member. After reviewing the above evidence, the hearing officer held that
“Grievant [McFarlane] appears to be a respectable individual, and he may well be quite deserving. However, permission was not obtained as required for his residence. In fairness to the many families on the waiting list for public housing, the regulations must be strictly applied. Grievant is not entitled to residual tenancy.” (Emphasis added.)
Thus, even though Mr. McFarlane had satisfactorily proven his occupancy of the apartment as a member of the tenant’s family and that he was otherwise eligible to become a NYCHA tenant, his application for remaining family member status was denied solely on the ground that his grandmother had failed to obtain written consent from NYCHA for his occupancy.
The facts in the Hayes case are similar in many ways. Petitioner Amanda Hayes moved into the NYCHA apartment with her grandmother Gloria Kelly in 1991 when she was six years old to attend a neighborhood program for gifted children. She testified how she played in the apartment, shared meals with her grandmother, and shared a bedroom with her. Amanda lived as a member of her grandmother’s family until her grandmother died on October 6, 1999. During the interim, as Amanda grew to be a teenager and her grandmother grew older and more infirm with heart disease, Amanda assisted in her grandmother’s care, even calling the ambulance to bring her to the hospital in her final moments.
Through the testimony of Amanda and her mother Vivian and through the documentary evidence adduced at the hearing, Amanda proved that she had been continuously living with her grandmother for more than eight years before her grandmother died. Since Amanda was still in school, her mother Vivian moved in with her when her grandmother died. An employee of the Board of Education, Vivian Hayes supported her daughter, having also contributed to her support in the prior years.
Thus, like Mr. McFarlane, Ms. Hayes proved the requisite continuous occupancy with the NYCHA tenant as a family member, and every indication was that she was otherwise eligible for a NYCHA tenancy. When asked whether her grandmother had obtained written consent for her occupancy, Amanda responded that she did not know. Her mother (the tenant’s daughter) testified that Ms. Kelly had intended to obtain consent for Amanda’s occupancy but had not done so because she was ill.
By decision dated August 19, 2002, NYCHA Hearing Officer Joan Parnell denied the request by Ms. Hayes for a lease based solely on the tenant’s failure to obtain written consent, stating as follows:
“Grievant appears to be a responsible young lady and may well be deserving. It seems credible that she did indeed live with her grandmother for many years. However, permission for her residence was not obtained or even requested. She is accordingly not entitled to residual tenancy. In fairness to the many families on the waiting list for public housing, the regulations must he strictly applied.” (Emphasis added.)
NYCHA’s Decisions are Arbitrary and Capricious
Pursuant to CPLR 7803 (3), this court is empowered to annul an administrative decision that is “arbitrary and capricious” or without a rational basis in the record. (See, Via v Franco, 223 AD2d 479 [1st Dept 1996] [affirming lower court’s decision to annul as “arbitrary and capricious” NYCHA’s denial of consent for tenant’s sister to join the household and the concomitant denial of remaining family member status].) As explained by the Court of Appeals: “The arbitrary or capricious test chiefly ‘relates to whether a particular action should have been taken or is justified . . . and whether the administrative action is without foundation in fact.’ . . . Arbitrary action is without sound basis in reason and is generally taken without regard to the facts.” (Matter of Pell v Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist. No. 1, 34 NY2d 222, 231 [1974] [citations omitted].)
To apply the “arbitrary and capricious” test in the cases at bar, one must examine the Appellate Division’s reasoning in Abdil and the facts of that case as compared to the facts of the two cases herein. The Abdil Court began by discussing the context for the written consent requirement. (307 AD2d 238 [2003].) As noted by the Court, NYCHA administers federally funded housing programs in accordance with regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Those regulations mandate that NYCHA promulgate and adhere to certain tenant selection guidelines. (See, 24 CFR 960.202 [a].) However, neither the applicable federal law (the United States Code), nor the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), contains a definition of “remaining family member” or otherwise specifies the criteria for a finding of remaining family member status. The provision of the CFR most directly relevant here is 24 CFR 966.4 (a) (1) (v). That section, under the heading “Lease requirements,” provides that
“A lease shall be entered into between the PHA [public housing authority] and each tenant of a dwelling unit which . . . shall state . . . [t]he composition of the household as approved by the PHA (family members and any PHA-approved live-in-aide). The family must promptly inform the PHA of the birth, adoption or court-awarded custody of a child. The family must request PHA approval to add any other family member as an occupant of the unit.”
Thus, while the CFR mandates that the lease include a written consent requirement for adding family members to the household, the CFR does not mandate the denial of remaining family member status when such consent has not been obtained. This fact was confirmed by the Appellate Division when it described the written consent requirement in Abdil as “a policy that only accommodates federal law” (307 AD2d at 241), as opposed to a rule or regulation mandated by federal law which should be rigidly applied in every remaining family member case.
Nor does the lease itself require written consent as a condition to a finding of remaining family member status. On the contrary, the Appellate Division in Abdil was careful to note that NYCHA was merely “contractually entitled” to deny remaining family member status in the absence of written consent. This conclusion is consistent with the lease which, like the CFR, does not define “remaining family member” or otherwise mandate a denial of remaining family member status in the absence of written consent.
In fact, the relevant language in the lease is extraordinarily limited. Notwithstanding the above-quoted mandate in 24 CFR 966.4 (a) (1) (v), the lease does not state the composition of the household. It merely identifies the leaseholder, who is typically the adult head of the household. The only reference to family composition is in the occupancy clause, which provides that the apartment shall be used as a residence for the tenant “and members of his household named in the Tenant’s signed application.” The lease clause makes no mention of persons added to the household after the initial lease application has been filed.
Nor does the NYCHA document entitled “Rules and Regulations” referenced in the lease make any mention of remaining family member status. It merely includes a general requirement that “Except for additions to the Tenant’s family resulting from births, [Tenant is required] to obtain the Housing Manager’s consent in writing before allowing any person, other than a member of the Tenant’s family listed in the Tenant’s Certificate, to take up residence in the Tenant’s apartment.” (Emphasis in original.)
The only document which expressly addresses “remaining family member” status is the NYCHA Management Manual which was at the heart of the dispute in Abdil. The manual (at ch IY subd iy § J) defines “remaining family member” to include any occupant who
• was a member of the original tenant family, or
• subsequent to move in, was born or legally adopted into the tenant family, or
• became a permanent member of the tenant family subsequent to move in with the written consent of management (the “written consent” requirement), and
• thereafter remained in continuous occupancy up to and including the time the tenant of record moved or died.
Justice Madden in Abdil found that this section in the manual was unenforceable, and she therefore annulled a NYCHA decision which had denied remaining family member status in reliance on the above-cited written consent requirement. (194 Misc 2d 203 [Sup Ct, NY County 2002].) Specifically, on a number of grounds, Justice Madden found that the written consent requirement constituted a “rule” which was not effective as it had not been filed with and approved by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal as required by Public Housing Law § 54 (1). (194 Misc 2d at 212.) The Appellate Division, First Department, reversed Justice Madden’s decision, finding that the written consent requirement “is not governed by the filing requirement set forth in Public Housing Law § 54” (307 AD2d at 242) because it “is a policy that only accommodates federal law, and notwithstanding the nomenclature in the Manual, is not a formal ‘rule or regulation’.” (307 AD2d at 241.)
Particularly significant is the distinction which the Appellate Division made in Abdil between a “rule” and a “policy.” The same distinction had been made by the Appellate Division, First Department, only three weeks earlier in Matter of 439 E. 88 Owners Corp. v Tax Commn. of City of N.Y. (307 AD2d 203 [2003]). That case considered a “supplemental policy” instituted by the Tax Commission in the wake of the highly publicized indictment of two individuals for paying bribes to city tax assessors. The policy mandated an “automatic denial of a merits-based review and summary confirmation of the assessment” if the property owner either refused to disclose whether he had dealt with the indicted individuals or confirmed that they had had such dealings. (Id.) The Appellate Division then held “The IAS court correctly held that since this ostensible ‘policy’ dictates a specific result in particular circumstances without regard to other circumstances relevant to the regulatory scheme, it constitutes a ‘rule’ [which must be properly promulgated].” (Id.)
Here, the NYCHA hearing officer relied on the absence of written consent to allow the “automatic denial of a merits-based review” of petitioner’s application. (Id.) NYCHA wrongly applied the policy to “ dictate [ ] a specific result [in the absence of written consent] without regard to other circumstances . . . .” (Id.) As such, the hearing officer treated the “policy” as if it were a “rule” in contravention of the Appellate Division’s analysis in the Abdil and Tax Commn. cases.
In reaching its decision in Tax Commn., the Appellate Division relied on the decision by the Court of Appeals in Matter of Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany v New York State Dept. of Health (66 NY2d 948 [1985], revg on dissent of Levine, J., 109 AD2d 140 [3d Dept 1985]). In that case, the Diocese had challenged the permission which the New York State Department of Health (DOH) had granted to Planned Parenthood to expand nonhospital abortion services in the cities of Albany and Hudson. In granting the permission, DOH had relied on its “50% rule.” Pursuant to that rule, when less than 50% of a locality’s abortions were being performed in nonhospital clinics, the DOH deemed that region of the state to be in need of additional non-hospital services. Finding that Albany and Hudson satisfied these criteria, DOH granted Planned Parenthood permission to expand its nonhospital abortion services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese, in an article 78 proceeding, challenged the DOH determination, claiming that the “50% rule” on which it was based was a “rule” which had not been properly promulgated. The Appellate Division agreed, finding that “DOH impermissibly relied upon a rigid numerical policy (the 50% rule) not found in any statute or regulation.” (109 AD2d at 145.) Justice Howard A. Levine vigorously dissented in a lengthy opinion (109 AD2d at 146-149) which the Court of Appeals ultimately adopted. In so doing, the Court of Appeals stated:
“[W]e agree with Justice Howard A. Levine, the dissenter at the Appellate Division, that only a fixed, general principle to be applied by an administrative agency without regard to other facts and circumstances relevant to the regulatory scheme of the statute it administers constitutes a rule or regulation . . . We agree also, for the reasons stated by the dissenting Justice . . . that the 50% guideline employed by the Department of Health in passing on the applications involved in the present proceeding did not constitute and was not applied as such a rule . . . .” (66 NY2d at 951 [emphasis added].)
Justice Levine had found that the “50% rule” was a “policy” rather than a “rule” because it was “neither the sole nor the determinative basis for the [agency’s] finding” of public need for the proposed abortion facilities. (109 AD2d at 146.) Rather, it was “a nonconclusive, nonbinding guideline to be weighed along with other factors on the public need issue in adjudicating individual cases.” (109 AD2d at 148.) Included among those factors were medical and population trends, issues relating to confidentiality and cost, and public policy. (109 AD2d at 146-147.) Thus, while the 50% calculation was undeniably a factor in the DOH determination, it was not “a ‘preset, rigid numerical policy . . . which foredoomed’ the result without reference to the facts and merits of the application.” (109 AD2d at 147, quoting Matter of Sturman v Ingraham, 52 AD2d 882, 885 [1976].)
In reaching his conclusion, Justice Levine relied on, and oftentimes quoted, various cases by the Court of Appeals and the Appellate Divisions defining the circumstances when a policy had been erroneously applied as a rigid rule. He emphasized that “an agency is free to evolve standards, if consistent with the statutory framework, on a case-by-case basis and to apply them to the individual proceeding at hand [as] ‘a guideline for a case-by-case analysis of the facts’ . . . .” (109 AD2d at 148 [citations omitted].) However, unless the standard is filed as a rule, it may not be applied as “a rigid, unvariable standard or procedure completely conclusive of the rights and remedies of the affected party.” (109 AD2d at 147.) Wholly improper is the “mechanical application” of a policy so it “establishes a pattern or course of conduct for the future” (109 AD2d at 147 [citation omitted and emphasis in original]).
NYCHA’s determinations in the two proceedings before this court clearly run afoul of Justice Levine’s prescriptions, as adopted by the Court of Appeals in the Roman Catholic Diocese case. As the NYCHA hearing officer herself noted, the written consent requirement was “strictly applied.” It was applied as if it were a standard “completely conclusive of the rights and remedies of the affected party.” (Roman Catholic Diocese, 109 AD2d at 147.) In each case, the denial of the petitioner’s application was “foredoomed” by the absence of written consent, regardless of the other factors in the case, as if the written consent requirement were a rule.
Further support for this court’s determination may be found in various other cases decided by the Court of Appeals in reliance on the Roman Catholic Diocese decision, such as Matter of Schwartfigure v Hartnett (83 NY2d 296 [1994]). In Schwartfigure, the petitioner had applied for unemployment benefits and was found qualified to receive them. Thereafter, the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board (the Board) reversed the decision due to no fault of petitioner, resulting in an overpayment of $2,112. Two years later, petitioner filed for unemployment benefits and was again found qualified. However, based on its long-standing policy, the Department of Labor (DOL) withheld 50% of the benefits to recoup the previous overpayment and summarily rejected petitioner’s request to repay the overpayment in smaller installments. While acknowledging the DOL’s common-law right of setoff, the Schwartfigure court held that the DOL had erred in the manner in which it had implemented the policy, stating (at 301) that “Respondent’s 50% set-off policy for nonwillful overpayments is a rigid, numerical policy invariably applied across-the-board to all claimants without regard to individualized circumstances or mitigating factors, and as such falls plainly within the definition of a ‘rule’ . . . .”
Schwartfigure is particularly significant here in that it addresses the relationship between an agency’s right to develop a particular policy and the manner in which that right is exercised or that policy is implemented or applied. Just as the DOL had a right of setoff, NYCHA is entitled to require written consent for additional family members joining a household, and it is entitled to consider the absence of any such consent when determining remaining family member status. As in Schwartfigure, however, NYCHA erred in that it exercised that right and implemented that policy in the cases at bar as a rigid, dispositive rule to determine a result “without regard to individualized circumstances or mitigating factors” in contravention of the dictates of the Court of Appeals in Schwartfigure (83 NY2d at 301). Just as the DOL when applying its policy in Schwartfigure should have considered that the overpayment had not been caused by any willfulness or wrongdoing by petitioner, so NYCHA here when applying its policy should have considered that the absence of written consent was not the fault of petitioners, who were minors with no authority to act.
The same analysis applies regardless of whether the written consent requirement is viewed as a procedural or a substantive requirement. This point was established by the Court of Appeals in Matter of Cordero v Corbisiero (80 NY2d 771 [1992]).
Cordero involved the “Saratoga policy,” which requires that a suspension imposed for an infraction committed at the Saratoga racetrack be served at the Saratoga meet the following year. The policy established “a mandatory procedure that pertains only to when and where a Saratoga suspension must be served,” as opposed to ""the substantive merits of the penalty itself. (80 NY2d at 773 [emphasis in original].) Nevertheless, the Court found that the policy functioned as a “rule” because it was applied “to every jockey” and served as the “agency’s stated policy of general applicability which prescribes a procedure or practice requirement of the agency.” (Id.; compare, Matter of Alca Indus. v Delaney, 92 NY2d 775, 779 [1999] [bid withdrawal criteria set by the Department of Transportation constituted “policy” in that the criteria applied only to the particular contract based on the “specifications and requirements . . . necessary for each project,” as opposed to “any and all” contract bidding]; Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v New York State Dept. of Labor, 88 NY2d 225, 229 [1996] [although specifying a numerical formula for calculating the penalty, the guidelines were applied as a “policy” to “vest inspectors with significant discretion, and allow for flexibility in the imposition of penalties, all with the view of imposing the appropriate sanction for the individual offense and offender in the particular case (and enabling inspectors to) use their professional judgment to adjust the penalty scale based on consideration of mitigating and contributing factors”]; Matter of Dejesus v Roberts, 296 AD2d 307, 310 [1st Dept 2002] [as the application of the criteria for admission into the alternative management program was “broadly discretionary” and “(m)any of the determinative factors are subjective or imprecise,” the criteria were properly applied as a “policy,” rather than as a “fixed, general principle” or “rule”].)
In sum, in the two cases before this court, neither the CFR nor the lease mandates that the written consent requirement be satisfied before remaining family member status can be granted. Further, as recently confirmed by the Appellate Division in Abdil, the written consent requirement in the manual is a “policy” rather than a “rule.” Accordingly, the policy may not be mechanically applied to bar a finding of remaining family member status based solely on the absence of written consent to the occupancy without regard to the other facts and circumstances of the individual case. However, as both NYCHA decisions at issue here make clear, the hearing officer “strictly applied” the policy to “dictate[ ] a specific result in particular circumstances [where written consent was absent] without regard to other circumstances relevant to the regulatory scheme” in contravention of the Tax Commn. case. (307 AD2d 203.) The hearing officer accorded no weight to the significant mitigating circumstances in each individual case, but instead treated the policy as a “fixed, general principle” or as a “rule” as defined by the Roman Catholic Diocese case and its progeny.
Unlike Abdil, the instant cases include significant mitigating circumstances. In Abdil, the person who moved in with the tenant was the tenant’s adult daughter who moved in because she was having difficulties with her own child’s father. She lived in the apartment for a mere few months before the tenant of record died.
In sharp contrast, both petitioners herein were minors when they commenced their occupancy in the NYCHA apartment units. Both helped to look after their elderly and infirm relatives who were the NYCHA tenants of record. Both were long-term residents who occupied the NYCHA apartment for a period of six to eight years before the tenant of record died.
Of all the distinctions between these cases and Abdil, the distinction which appears most fundamental is that the petitioners herein were minors when they commenced their occupancy. As minors, they presumably had no knowledge or understanding of any written consent requirement and they were, in any event, without authority to act. Our society recognizes in a variety of circumstances that minors have such limitations, and our society protects minors from prejudice as a result of those limitations by, for example, tolling the statute of limitations for a minor to commence a lawsuit (CPLR 208). Similarly, in a criminal proceeding involving a minor, a parent or guardian must be present before an interrogation can occur or before constitutional rights can be waived.
The functional limitations of the tenants of record, due to their age and infirmity, are also significant distinctions from Abdil. Indeed, NYCHA recognizes a similar point in its own manual. In a section entitled “Changes in Family Composition,” the manual provides that an exception exists to the written consent requirement if, during the 90-day period after the tenant applies for consent to add an occupant, the tenant dies or becomes physically' or mentally incapacitated. In such cases, the additional person in the apartment shall be deemed to have lawfully entered the apartment, and may qualify as a “remaining family member,” notwithstanding the absence of written consent. (See also, Mental Hygiene Law art 81 [recognizing the special circumstances of persons with functional limitations caused by advanced age or infirmity].)
Conclusion
This court finds that the two NYCHA determinations at issue in the instant proceedings are arbitrary and capricious because the hearing officer failed to consider the numerous mitigating circumstances and relevant individual facts relating to each tenant’s failure to obtain written consent for the respective family members, who were minors, to move into the apartment with their grandmothers. Although NYCHA may well have the right to establish a written consent requirement, as a “policy” the written consent requirement must be applied with regard to the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case. To the extent the hearing officer “strictly applied” the written consent requirement to deny remaining family member status based solely on the failure of the elderly tenant of record to request such consent, without regard to the significant mitigating facts, the hearing officer treated the requirement as a rigid, dispositive “rule” and therefore erred under the Roman Catholic Diocese case and its progeny.
For the reasons indicated above, Abdil does not mandate a different result. Quite the contrary, this court’s conclusion is based in large part on the Appellate Division’s analysis in Abdil. Nor is a different result mandated by the various appellate cases which have upheld the application of the written consent requirement in various contexts, as all of those cases are distinguishable from the cases at bar. Indeed, because a written consent requirement is a “policy,” rather than a “rule,” which serves as a guideline rather than a mandate, the facts of each case are critical.
The two cases cited by the Appellate Division in Abdil are distinctly different from the two cases at issue here. In the first, Matter of Faison v New York City Hous. Auth. (283 AD2d 353 [1st Dept 2001]), the Appellate Division upheld NYCHA’s authority to deny remaining family member status to an occupant with a fairly extensive criminal record who had engaged in criminal conduct even during the pendency of his claim. In Matter of Barnhill v New York City Hous. Auth. (280 AD2d 339 [1st Dept 2001]), the Appellate Division upheld NYCHA’s denial on default of remaining family member status. Finding the applicant’s failure to establish a reasonable excuse for the default and a meritorious defense, the Court emphasized that “the original tenant stymied the Housing Authority’s efforts to verify the status of these squatters, resulting in the default challenged herein.” (280 AD2d at 339.)
Also readily distinguishable are the various cases cited by respondent NYCHA herein. The applicant in Rentas v New York City Hous. Auth. (282 AD2d 215 [1st Dept 2001]) was the tenant’s adult half-sister who, unlike the minors herein, had the ability to contact the NYCHA management office herself when she moved into the apartment if the tenant of record did not act. Various other cases are similarly distinguishable from the cases at bar based on the occupant’s status as an adult, rather than a minor. (See, e.g., Matter of Davis v Franco, 270 AD2d 55 [1st Dept 2000] [tenant’s adult brother was denied remaining family member status]; Matter of Kolarick v Franco, 240 AD2d 204 [1st Dept 1997] [tenant’s adult son was denied status].) Similarly distinguishable is Matter of Powell v Franco (276 AD2d 430 [1st Dept 2000]), where the Court upheld the denial of a request to join the household based on overcrowding.
In sum, this court’s decision annulling the NYCHA decisions is wholly consistent with Abdil and other appellate authority, the CFR, and our society’s protection of minors and its recognition of the special needs of persons with functional limitations. It is also wholly consistent with our society’s respect for “family,” be it traditional or nontraditional, and the desire to encourage family members to share a household. (See, Braschi v Stahl Assoc. Co., 74 NY2d 201 [1989].)
Accordingly, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the petitions of Marco McFarlane and Amanda Hayes are granted, the respective decisions by the NYCHA hearing officer denying petitioners remaining family member status are annulled, and the applications for remaining family member status be and hereby are granted.
. The decision of the hearing officer states “1974” as the move-in date, an obvious typographical error as confirmed by the other evidence adduced at the hearing.
. Because Amanda was only 17 when this proceeding was commenced, the petition was brought in the name of “Vivian Hayes on behalf of Amanda Hayes, a minor.” Amanda is now 18, eligible to proceed and claim the lease in her own right.
. Significantly, Hearing Officer Parnell, in denying Ms. Hayes’ grievance, used language virtually identical to that used in denying Mr. McFarlane’s grievance a few months earlier, focusing on the need to “strictly apply” the written consent requirement to remaining family members.
. The Abdil Court also cited for purposes of context various CFR provisions which obligate the tenant to provide information about family composition for purposes of determining the rent, eligibility, and apartment size. Lastly, it cited 24 CFR 966.4 (f) (2) and (3), which calls for lease provisions prohibiting “boarders or lodgers” and limiting the use of the apartment “as a private dwelling for the tenant and the tenant’s household as identified in the lease.”
. Similar language is included in the affidavit of income which tenants must complete annually to enable NYCHA to calculate the rent. Because petitioners in the instant proceedings moved in as minors and had no income, their inclusion on the form would not have affected the rent. In any event, the hearing officer did not specify any omission in the income affidavit as a ground for denying remaining family member status. The only ground is the failure to obtain written consent, and judicial review is therefore limited to that ground. (Matter of Scherbyn v Wayne-Finger Lakes Bd. of Coop. Educ. Servs., 77 NY2d 753, 758 [1991].)
. Exceptions also exist for children born to or adopted by the tenant while in occupancy, and for persons who request consent to join the household when NYCHA fails to decide the request within 90 days. However, those exceptions are not relevant here, except to the extent they suggest that exceptions to the written consent requirement are appropriate based on individual circumstances.
. Other distinguishing facts may also exist in the administrative record.
. The administrative record establishes all the facts necessary for such a finding, and NYCHA made no objection at the hearing to petitioners’ applications based on any of its criteria other than the written consent requirement.Accordingly, no remand is required.",0
0685-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Maria Milin, J.
In this nonpayment proceeding where petitioner seeks rental arrears from June 1998 through June 2002, respondent moves for an order pursuant to CPLR 3212 for partial summary judgment dismissing with prejudice all claims for rent accruing prior to August 1999. Respondent succeeded to the rent-controlled tenancy of Philip Cuppett after his death in August 1999. It is undisputed that prior to the death of Mr. Cuppett, respondent never tendered rent in her own name to petitioner, nor did petitioner make respondent a tenant. Petitioner opposes. Based upon the discussion below, respondent’s motion is granted.
Any party may move for summary judgment once issue is joined (CPLR 3212). “When saved for a proper case it is a perfectly constitutional weapon. It does not deny the parties a trial; it merely ascertains that there is nothing to try” (Siegel, NY Prac § 278, at 438 [3d ed]).
Although the premises here is governed by rent control, not rent stabilization, the court adopts the rationale and methodology of the Appellate Division, First Department. The timing of the transition determining when an occupant of a rent-stabilized tenancy becomes the successor-in-interest to the tenant was addressed by the Court in 245 Realty Assoc. v Sussis (243 AD2d 29, 33 [1st Dept 1998]), which held: “The occupant’s rights as a successor-in-interest logically must relate back to the date creating his statutory rights, the death of the tenant of record.” This holding is consistent with Duell v Condon (84 NY2d 773 [1995]), where the Court of Appeals held that the adult daughter who moved in with her mother, the statutory rent-controlled tenant, in 1973, became the statutory tenant upon the death of her mother in 1986.
Thus, based upon the death certificate annexed to respondent’s motion, respondent succeeded to the rent-controlled tenancy as of August 16, 1999. Since petitioner pleads that respondent agreed to pay rent each month in advance on the first day of the month, respondent’s obligation to pay rent directly to petitioner commenced September 1, 1999.
None of the cases cited by petitioner addresses the specific issue of when an occupant becomes a successor-in-interest to the rent-regulated tenant.
In Stanford Realty Assoc. v Rollins (161 Misc 2d 754 [Civ Ct, NY County 1994]), a holdover petition based upon nonprimary residence was dismissed for failure to serve predicate notices on the tenant’s wife, whom the court determined had independent possessory rights and thus was a necessary party. In 87-37 Bay Owners Corp. v D’Angelo (183 Misc 2d 558 [Civ Ct, Kings County 2000]) the court held that the wife of a residential cooperative corporation unit owner, who did not reside in the premises but paid the rent, could assert a breach of the warranty of habitability claim against petitioner. In Matter of Her zog v Joy (74 AD2d 372 [1st Dept 1980], affd 53 NY2d 821 [1981]) the Court held that the younger sister of the rent-controlled tenant succeeded to her older sister’s tenancy after the older sister vacated, and that the fact that the older sister still paid the rent was not determinative of whether the younger sister was a tenant under rent control.
Petitioner also relies upon 245 Realty Assoc. v Sussis (243 AD2d 29 [1st Dept 1998]) to argue that respondent is an assignee under the lease and as such is bound by the terms of the lease, including the obligation to pay rent. But in that case the lease contained a provision which provided that the agreement was to be binding on the owner and tenant and on those who succeeded to their interests. There is no such provision in the rent-controlled lease here.
Based upon the foregoing respondent’s motion for partial summary judgment is granted.",0
0671-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Edward H. Lehner, J.
The prime legal issue presented on the motions before me is whether an insurer who issued liability policies for two consecutive years, each of which provides $1,000,000 of coverage for any one “occurrence,” may be held liable for more than that sum when the insured landlord is sued by infant tenants for lead-based paint poisoning occurring over several years.
The motions before me are by plaintiffs National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. and OneBeacon Insurance for summary judgment on their claims against Farmington Casualty Company and a cross motion by Farmington to dismiss the complaint.
These three insurers provided coverage to River Edge Associates, a landlord who was sued by four infant tenants who claimed to have suffered lead paint poisoning while occupying an apartment in the insured’s building over a period of up to seven years. That underlying action was settled, with said insurers agreeing to pay the infants a total of $2,875,000. The insurers further agreed amongst themselves that the pro rata basis for allocation purposes would be determined based on the number of months each insurer provided coverage (weighted based on the number of infants residing in the apartment each month) over a seven-year period, which agreed percentages were as follows:
Farmington 44.5%
National 18.3%
Beacon 37.2%
Since the insurers desired to settle the underlying action even though Farmington took the position that its total liability was only $1,000,000, the infants’ compromise order provided that each insurer would pay the following amounts:
Farmington $1,000,000.00
Beacon 1,209,187.50
National 665,812.50
Said agreement as to payment was arrived at with Beacon and National reserving the right to assert in a subsequent action that Farmington should have paid (based on the aforesaid allocation) 44.5% of the total settlement of $2,875,000, or $1,279,375. Thus, in this action National and Beacon each seek $139,687.50, that amount being one half of the alleged Farming-ton underpayment of $279,375.
All parties agree that there was only one “occurrence,” although a continuous injury (transcript at 12-15). Based on this agreement, Farmington argues that even though it agreed that its pro rata time of coverage was 44.5% it is liable only for $1,000,000, which was the amount of each insurer’s coverage for each year that protection was provided. Plaintiffs contend that since Farmington insured the subject building for two years, its limitation of liability was $2,000,000, and hence it is liable for the aforesaid sum of $279,379. Beacon also notes that, if Farmington is correct, it too should riot have paid more than $1,000,000 (there being no contention that the limitation of liability provisions are not similar in all of the subject policies). Farmington responds by asserting that when Beacon paid more than $1,000,000 (it having provided coverage for four years), it did so voluntarily and thus would not be entitled to reimbursement from any other party.
Regarding allocation among settling insurers in a lead paint case, the Second Department recently held in Serio v Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co. (304 AD2d 167 [2003]), that “each insurer shall bear a share of liability for the purpose of funding their negotiated settlement with the injured parties, directly proportionate to each insurer’s time on the risk” (at 168). The Court observed that the “instant case is the first lead-paint case in New York to employ a time on the risk analysis” and, noting the paucity of law on the subject, stated “we have not found a single lead-paint case that has ever expressly rejected the use of a time on the risk analysis” (id. at 173 [emphasis in original]). In so holding, the Court relied on the Court of Appeals decision in Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v Allstate Ins. Co. (98 NY2d 208 [2002]), where the Court approved a time on the risk allocation among several insurers on a claim of pollution that allegedly occurred over a period of 60 years. (See also, Olin Corp. v Insurance Co. of N. Am., 221 F3d 307 [2d Cir 2000].)
Farmington does not challenge the time on the risk means of allocating coverage as was approved in the aforesaid cases. However, it correctly contends that the issue it raises herein was not presented in those cases. Here, the policies issued by Farmington over a two-year period each provided for a limitation of liability of $1,000,000 “for any one occurrence.”
Illustrative of the seeming inequity of Farmington’s position, it maintained that if it were the only insurer providing coverage to the landlord over a seven-year period during which time the infant tenants were subjected to lead poisoning because of conditions in their apartment, its total liability coverage regarding the claims of the infants would still be limited to $1,000,000 in light of the conceded “one occurrence” (transcript at 15). Also, the court notes a pragmatic difficulty in sustaining the position advanced by Farmington as, if all relevant policies contain similar limitation of liability provisions, it would behoove a landlord to change its lead paint liability carrier annually and to never renew a policy. Of course, although a landlord could attempt to negotiate a change in the language of its policy to specifically provide that the limitation is per policy period, obtaining a change in the language of a “standard” policy is often very difficult and, if granted, might entail an extra premium.
It is further observed that to uphold Farmington’s position would mean that when the landlord renewed its policy and paid a premium for a second year it procured no additional protection regarding lead-based paint claims above the $1,000,000. Examining the hypothetical fact pattern referred to above where a policy with one company is renewed for seven years, the landlord would have paid premiums all during those years and yet may not have been provided protection for lead paint liability any greater than if it had maintained the policy for only one year, with an apparent consequential windfall to the insurer whose policy is renewed.
While, as aforesaid, the parties agree that there has been only one “occurrence,” no party refers to any definition of that term in any policy. It has recently been stated by the Second Circuit in the case involving the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center that there “is no well settled definition” of that term under New York law, and that court referred to one of its prior holdings when it concluded that the meaning of the term “must be interpreted in the context of the specific policy and facts of the case” (World Trade Ctr. Props., L.L.C. v Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 345 F3d 154, 189, 190 [2003]).
Although the controversy herein is among insurers, the interpretation of the policies involved should be no different than if a judgment had been rendered against the landlord insured and it was seeking payment from its insurers. A policy’s interpretation does not vary depending on who are the contesting parties.
“The tests to be applied in construing an insurance policy are common speech . . . and the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary businessman . . . [and] ambiguities in an insurance policy are, moreover, to be construed against the insurer” (Ace Wire & Cable Co. v Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 60 NY2d 390, 398 [1983]). In Mostow v State Farm Ins. Cos. (88 NY2d 321 [1996]), it was stated that “the test to determine whether an insurance contract is ambiguous focuses on the reasonable expectations of the average insured upon reading the policy . . . and employing common speech” (at 326-327). “Moreover, the circumstances particular to each case must be considered in construing the meaning of the term.” (General Assur. Co. v Schmitt, 265 AD2d 299, 300 [2d Dept 1999].)
Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, I find that, since a landlord of an older building which may have lead paint problems is likely aware that any claims that may be made by infant tenants regarding lead poisoning would probably involve multiple years of occupancy, the “reasonable expectation” of such a businessman employing “common speech” would be that the limitation of $1,000,000 is per policy period. Otherwise the landlord, as noted above, would obtain no likely appreciable benefit with regard to lead-based paint liability by renewing a policy with the same insurer. It is well known that judgments in cases of lead paint poisoning often exceed the aforesaid limitation of $1,000,000, particularly when there are several children residing in an affected apartment. I further find that it is unlikely that a reasonable businessperson would renew a policy providing lead paint protection if it were not intended that the payment of the renewal premium would increase the protection with respect to lead-based paint liability, claims with respect to which are often not asserted until after the passage of several years.
Accordingly, I find and declare that the policy issued by Farmington provided lead paint liability insurance of $1,000,000 per year and that, since it provided coverage for two years, it provided such liability coverage to the landlord of up to $2,000,000. Thus, the motion of plaintiffs is granted and each plaintiff is entitled to recover of Farmington the sum of $139,687.50, with interest thereon from the date of payment to the infant plaintiffs in the underlying action. The cross motion of defendant is granted solely to the extent of dismissing the second cause of action asserting bad faith by defendant as plaintiffs have set forth no factual basis for said claim.",0
0293-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Renée Forgensi Minarik, J.
By decision and order filed November 21, 2002, I denied the application of DeBartolo Capital Partnership for permission to file a late claim pursuant to section 10 (6) of the Court of Claims Act. The proposed claim had asserted a cause of action for the State’s appropriation of land owned by DeBartolo. With this motion, DeBartolo has asked for reargument/renewal of that earlier decision. DeBartolo argues that the court misapprehended and misapplied the law regarding the “full settlement” provision of EDPL 503 (A). Upon oral argument from counsel, I denied DeBartolo’s request for renewal, but granted its request for reargument, largely because claimant convinced me that its failure to directly address the application of EDPL 503 (A) was an inadvertent and understandable oversight on claimant’s part. I now, therefore, again address the merits of DeBartolo’s contention that it is entitled to late claim relief.
Background
Claimant, the owner of Eastern Hills Mall in Clarence, New York, and defendant agree on the facts underlying the proposed claim. The State appropriated property owned by claimant when the Department of Transportation undertook to widen Transit Road in the vicinity of the Mall. On January 29, 1998, the State filed a notice of appropriation and certified copies of the pertinent maps in the office of the Erie County Clerk. On April 3, 1998, claimant was served with a notice of appropriation by certified mail, return receipt requested.
At some point between this time and March of 1999, the State made an offer of settlement to claimant in the amount of $89,900. By letter dated March 18, 1999, claimant, believing that the value of the land taken was worth more than the value ascribed by the State, submitted an agreement of adjustment indicating that it valued the land at $148,523. The State responded to this submission by requesting from claimant documentation supporting claimant’s valuation of the land.
For whatever reason, the negotiations ended there and no further action was taken on the matter until September of 2000, when claimant submitted a request for payment of the $89,900 previously offered by the State. Due to claimant’s failure to properly execute the agreement of adjustment submitted with this request, payment to claimant could not be made at that time. In April of 2002, claimant submitted a properly executed agreement for advance payment, together with a cover letter reserving its rights “to file a claim in the Court of Claims” for additional monies it believed it was owed. On May 15, 2002, defendant paid to claimant the principal amount of $89,900, together with $22,416.59 in interest for a total of $112,316.59. After accepting this payment, claimant filed its initial motion for late claim relief on July 5, 2002.
In the earlier motion, I found that claimant’s acceptance of defendant’s payment of $112,316.59, coupled with the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations contained in the EDPL, triggered the “full settlement” provision of EDPL 503 (A). For this reason, I determined that claimant had failed to demonstrate the merit of its proposed claim and I denied the motion. Claimant now argues that I misapplied this section of the EDPL and misinterpreted case law relating to it because I failed to consider two significant facts. First, claimant accepted payment from the State after expiration of the three-year period. Second, claimant submitted its request for payment with a cover letter which explicitly reserved its right to commence an action in the Court of Claims. I will address claimant’s concerns in order.
Payment After Expiration of the Three-Year Period
Claimant alleges, on page three of its December 26, 2002 memorandum of law, that I did not consider the significance of “the fact that claimant’s request for advance payment and subsequent payment of the amount originally offered by the defendant both took place after the expiration of the three-year statutory period specified in EDPL 503 (A).” Upon review, I find that claimant is mistaken on this point. I did consider the significance of the fact that payment occurred after the three-year period had elapsed. In fact, as one of the factors that triggered the “full settlement” provision of EDPL 503 (A), it was one of the key considerations upon which my decision was based.
Claimant asserts that section 503 (A) “[o]n its face . . . applies to payments received during the three year statutory period” (claimant’s Dec. 26, 2002 mem of law at 4). Claimant asserts that section 503 (A) does not address full settlement in, and therefore does not apply to, circumstances where payment is made after expiration of the three-year period. In support of this argument, on page four of its December 26, 2002 memorandum of law, claimant misquotes section 503 (A). While I am sure that this misquote was unintentional, it is, nonetheless, quite significant in light of the issue confronted in this application. Claimant’s memorandum reads as follows:
“The final sentence of Section 503 (A) is the ‘full settlement’ provision. That sentence provides that the failure of a condemnee to file any subsequent claim for additional compensation within such three year period ‘shall be deemed an acceptance of the amount previously paid as full settlement of such claim.’ ” (Emphasis added.)
The word “previously,” which could arguably imply a legislative intent consistent with claimant’s position, is not contained in the statute. The statute actually provides
“The claimant may, at any time subsequent to the running of the three year period, receive the amount of the condemnor’s offer upon proof of his entitlement thereto. The failure of a condemnee to file a claim within such three year period shall be deemed an acceptance of the amount paid as full settlement of such claim.” (Emphasis added.)
There is nothing in the statute which suggests that the payment must be made before the expiration of the three-year period in order for the “full settlement” provision to apply. Statutes must be construed “as written, according to the ordinary meaning of their language” (Riegert Apts. Corp. v Planning Bd. of Town of Clarkstown, 57 NY2d 206, 209 [1982]). I find that the use of the word “subsequent” in section 503 (A) demonstrates a clear and unambiguous legislative intent that a condemnee’s acceptance of payment subsequent to the expiration of the three-year period triggers the “full settlement” provision.
Claimant argues that acceptance of payment followed by expiration of the three-year period is a sequence of events necessary to trigger the “full settlement” provision. I find that they are rather a combination of events necessary to trigger that provision; a combination that exists in the case at hand. Claimant’s intent to treat the payment as an advance and to file a claim in the Court of Claims is of no moment. Claimant’s action of accepting payment after expiration of the three-year period operated to trigger the full settlement provision of the statute. Any other construction, in addition to doing violence to the clear meaning of the statute, would inexplicably reward claimant’s dilatory behavior by placing claimant in a more favorable position than a condemnee who acted expeditiously to accept an advance payment from the State. For these reasons, I find that claimant’s acceptance of payment “subsequent to the running of the three year period,” coupled with its failure “to file a claim within such three year period” operated to trigger the “full settlement” provision of EDPL 503 (A).
Claimant’s Reservation of Rights
The claimant argues that my earlier decision and order failed to address the effect of claimant’s explicit reservation of its right to file a late claim. This, of course, begs the question as to what right the claimant had to reserve. It is axiomatic that claimant could not reserve a right that it did not have, and that its right to commence an action against the State for appropriation expired after three years as prescribed by statute. It is also clear that no party has a right to file a late claim, but rather must petition the court for the exercise of that court’s discretion to permit the filing of a late claim. Simply put, the authority to grant a late claim, and the analysis necessary to determine the merits of such an application, are not affected one way or the other by the reservation of rights in claimant’s cover letter.
However, this issue also is specifically addressed in EDPL 304 (G), which provides: “The reservation of the right to claim additional compensation, pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision (A) of this section, shall not extend or affect in any way the time limit for the filing of such claim as provided in section five hundred three of this law.” I find that this section clearly disposes of claimant’s argument. The explicit reservation of rights contained in claimant’s cover letter did not operate to extend the time within which it would otherwise have had to commence an action against the State.
I would also note that the claimant makes an issue of the fact that it signed an agreement of advance payment and not an agreement of adjustment. Claimant does not explain in detail the significance of this fact relative to the application of section 503 (A), but implies that its alleged reservation of rights survives the former, if not the latter. However, the statute makes no distinction between the two, and in fact, an agreement for advance payment by its terms becomes an agreement of adjustment after the expiration of the three-year period. More importantly, regardless of what the payment is called, the statute itself provides that the condemnee may treat any payment as payment in full or, as long as the condemnee files his claim within the statutorily provided three-year period, as an advance payment. EDPL 304 (A) (3) states
“a condemnee may reject the offer as payment in full and instead elect to accept such offer as an . advance payment, and that such election shall in no way prejudice the right of a condemnee to claim additional compensation; however, the failure of the condemnee to file a claim within the time of filing claims as provided in subdivision (A) of section five hundred three of this law shall be deemed an acceptance of the amount paid as full settlement of such claim.”
I find that claimant’s cover letter, purporting to reserve its right to file a claim in the Court of Claims, did not operate to extend the statute of limitations. Nor did it somehow operate to prevent the application of the statutorily mandated “full settlement” provision of section 503 (A). I find claimant’s remaining contentions to be without merit.
For the reasons set forth above, upon reargument, claimant’s motion for permission to file a late claim is denied.",0
0399-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Louis B. York, J.
In these two “adult establishment” zoning ordinance actions, plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction, and defendants cross-move for summary judgment. Additionally, plaintiff in Ten’s Cabaret, Inc. v New York City (Index No. 121197/02) moves for summary judgment; and, plaintiffs in Pussycat Lounge, Inc. v City of New York (Index No. 122740/02) move to consolidate with Ten’s.
In Ten’s, the court grants plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and denies defendants’ cross motion for summary judgment. In addition, the court grants plaintiffs’ motion for consolidation in Pussycat, and also grants summary judgment for the plaintiffs as a result of this consolidation.
Background
Prior to November 23, 1994, the City of New York made no distinction between adult entertainment and commercial businesses without adult character. The New York City Zoning Resolution of December 15, 1961 allowed adult entertainment businesses to coexist with other commercial or residential land uses. In 1977, the City Planning Commission (CPC) concluded that adult entertainment uses had negatively impacted the five boroughs of New York City. The CPC proposed new zoning regulations to distinguish adult entertainment uses and restrict their potential locations. However, the Board of Estimate rejected the proposal because of disagreement about the appropriate extent of such regulations and concern that the regulations would cause the adult businesses to move to new locations. Residents appealed to local officials to shut down adult establishments in their neighborhoods. In response, officials closed adult video stores and bars in Astoria, Jackson Heights, Chelsea, Murray Hill, Forest Hills, and Bay Ridge. The number of adult establishments decreased from 151 in 1976 to 131 in 1984. However, the number of adult establishments increased by 35% in 1993. More than 75% of these businesses were in residential areas.
The City, concerned about the potential proliferation of adult uses, conducted a study of the negative secondary impacts of adult establishments in New York City. The Department of City Planning (DCP) study included (1) a survey of existing studies concerning the impacts of adult entertainment establishments and of regulation of such establishments in other localities; (2) a description of the adult entertainment businesses in New York City; (3) a review of studies and reports on adult entertainment establishments in New York City; (4) a DCP survey of the impacts these establishments have on communities in the City; and (5) a set of overall findings and recommendations. The 1993 DCP Report’s overall findings included: there had been a growth in the amount of adult entertainment establishments between 1984 and 1993; adult entertainment businesses tended to concentrate in one area; real estate brokers perceived that adult entertainment establishments negatively affected nearby property values and decreased market values; and adult establishments generally used large, illuminated, and sexually graphic signs, a fact which concerned community residents about the exposure of minors to sexual images. As a result, the 1993 DCP Report purported to link adult businesses to various adverse secondary effects, including nearby crime and lower property values.
Based on the 1993 DCP Report, the City decided to regulate adult entertainment establishments differently from other commercial establishments by restricting the location of adult uses proximate to residential areas, to houses of worship, to schools and to each other. Accordingly, following the issuance of the 1993 DCP Report, the New York City Council adopted application N 950113 for a text amendment to the Zoning Resolution, which became an amendment on November 23, 1994. The 1995 amendment to Zoning Resolution former § 11-113 (the 1995 Resolution) banned the extension or enlargement of existing adult businesses and prohibited the change of any use to an adult enterprise in all of New York City. The 1995 Resolution redefined “adult establishment”: “An ‘adult establishment’ is a commercial establishment where a ‘substantial portion’ of the establishment includes an adult bookstore, adult eating or drinking establishment, adult theater, or other adult commercial establishment, or any combination thereof . . . (N 950384 ZRY Resolution No. 1322 [L.U. No. 713], amending NY City Zoning Resolution former § 12-10). The text amendment pointed to the following factors to determine whether a “substantial portion” of the facility was “adult”: “(1) the amount of floor area and cellar space accessible to customers and allocated to [adult] uses; and (2) the amount of floor area and cellar space accessible to customers and allocated to [adult] uses as compared to the total floor area and cellar space accessible to customers in the establishment.” (NY City Zoning Resolution former § 12-10.) The 1995 Resolution also barred exclusively adult businesses from all residential zones and most commercial and manufacturing districts. (NY City Zoning Resolution former § 32-01 [a]; former § 42-01 [b].) In areas where adult establishments were permitted, the businesses had to be at least 500 feet from schools, churches, other adult establishments, and certain commercial and manufacturing districts. (NY City Zoning Resolution former § 32-01 [b]; former § 42-01 [b].) There was a one-year moratorium for existing adult establishments. Within this period the businesses had to conform to the 1995 Resolution or terminate their business. (NY City Zoning Resolution §§ 52-77, 52-734.)
In response to the 1995 Resolution, more than 100 owners and operators of adult establishments joined forces and took action against the City. The first action sought a declaratory judgment holding the 1995 Resolution unconstitutional. (Amsterdam Video, Inc. v City of New York, Sup Ct, NY County, Index No. 1035681/96.) In the second, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed Hickerson v City of New York (Sup Ct, NY County, Index No. 1035569/96) on behalf of consumers of adult expression. On July 22, 1996, counsel for adult-oriented cabarets commenced a third case challenging the 1995 Resolution. (Stringfellow’s of N.Y., Ltd. v City of New York, Sup Ct, NY County, Index No. 113049/96.)
Of particular relevance here, plaintiff in Amsterdam Video, Inc. sought to enjoin the law’s enforcement by claiming that the operative phrase “substantial portion” was fatally vague. (Amsterdam Video, Inc., SD, NY, Docket No. 96 Civ 2204 [MGC].) However, the City Planning Commission’s Report made it clear that any commercial establishment with “at least 40 percent of its accessible floor area used for adult purposes qualifies as an ‘adult establishment’ or ‘adult bookstore.’ ” (City Planning Commn Report, Sept. 18, 1995, at 50.) This equation became known as the “60/40 allocation.” The Operations Policy and Procedure Notice (OPPN) No. 4/98 confirmed the 60/40 equation:
“If at least 40 percent of the bookstore’s total stock accessible or available . . . for sale or rent to customers is comprised of adult materials, then the bookstore has a ‘substantial portion’ of its stock in adult materials, and is therefore an ‘adult bookstore.’ An establishment also includes an adult bookstore if 40 percent of the establishment’s floor area and cellar space accessible to customers contains stock in adult materials.” (OPPN No. 4/98.)
The actions were not formally consolidated, but a single decision upheld the regulations under the New York Constitution. (Stringfellow’s of N.Y. v City of New York, 171 Misc 2d 376 [Sup Ct, NY County 1996].) The First Department and Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. (Stringfellow’s of N.Y. v City of New York, 241 AD2d 360 [1st Dept 1997]; Stringfellow’s of N.Y. v City of New York, 91 NY2d 382 [1998].) The Court found that the 1995 Resolution was not vague, it was a sufficiently narrow solution to deal with the secondary effects, and the 1993 DCP Report served as a proper basis for the 1995 Resolution. (Id. at 397, 399-400.) In federal court, the court found that the businesses were collaterally estopped from pursuing their First Amendment claims. (Hickerson v City of New York, 997 F Supp 418 [SD NY 1998], affd 146 F3d 99 [2d Cir 1998], cert denied 525 US 1067 [1999].)
The 1995 Resolution effectively reduced the number of adult establishments from 177 in 1993 to 136 in 2000. (CPC Report, Aug. 8, 2001, at 6.) The 60/40 equation has been the governing standard since July 1998. Adult businesses radically altered themselves to ensure they were not “adult establishments’ ’ within the meaning of the Zoning Resolution. They reconfigured their accessible floor areas so that only 40% contained adult material. Adult bookstores purchased nonadult stock, such as nonadult videos, and adult theaters showed both adult and nonadult films. Nonetheless, the City brought claims against these businesses under the Nuisance Abatement Law (Administrative Code of City of NY § 7-701). In these nuisance abatement cases, the City consistently asserted that the adult establishments were in sham compliance with the 1995 Resolution. The City argued that based on the sale to rental ratio of the adult videos and the lack of need to replenish adult videos, it was clear that despite facial 60/40 compliance, really the store actually did more than 60% of its business in adult videos. (City of New York v Warehouse on the Block, 183 Misc 2d 489, 490 [Sup Ct, NY County 2000].) The Court of Appeals said the definition of “stock” does not allow an inquiry into whether inventory is moving. “Instead, the focus is solely on the appropriate percentages of stock and floor and cellar space, and the City drew these at 40% . . . [T]he City’s guidelines provide no support for the view that profitability or stability of the nonadult stock need be considered.” (City of New York v Les Hommes, 94 NY2d 267, 273 [1999]; see also, Warehouse on the Block, 183 Misc 2d at 491-492 [only relevant factors are stock and floor area].)
In response, on March 22, 2001, the Department of City Planning applied for a text amendment to the City Planning Commission on the ground that the adult establishments had been superficially complying with the 1995 Resolution. The City used the 1993 DCP Report, which was used to pass the 1995 Resolution, as evidence that the 2001 amendments were necessary and constitutional. The City did not conduct any research on the negative secondary impacts of 60/40 establishments. Defendants assert the amendment redefines “adult establishment,” “adult bookstore,” and “adult eating and drinking establishment” in order to address the problem of sham compliance with the law. Defendants assert that although Ten’s and For the People Theatres erected partitions to limit the adult entertainment to less than 40% of the floor area, this constituted sham compliance because most of its business was still generated by adult uses. Pussycat Lounge had even more trouble complying with the 1995 Resolution when it encountered numerous obstacles imposed by the Department of Buildings. (Pussycat Lounge, Inc. v City of New York, Sup Ct, NY County, Mar. 12, 1999, Index No. 121033/98.)
On October 31, 2001, the New York City Council adopted and ratified text amendment N 010508 ZRY to the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York. The 2001 amendments removed the phrase “substantial portion” from the definition of adult establishment, leaving the following: “An ‘adult establishment’ is a commercial establishment which is or includes an adult book store, adult eating or drinking establishment, adult theater, or other adult commercial establishment, or any combination thereof, as defined below.” (NY City Zoning Resolution § 12-10.) Thus, the 2001 amendments barred businesses containing any adult entertainment from operating within 500 feet of a church or school. Adult businesses that existed as of August 8, 2001 could operate until October 31, 2002; thereafter, the 2001 amendments could be enforced against them.
The plaintiffs in Ten’s and Pussycat moved by an order to show cause to temporarily enjoin and restrain defendants from enforcing the 2001 amendments. A temporary restraining order was issued pending this decision.
Municipalities have long had the authority to enact zoning laws to prevent urbanization from harming the quality of residential life. (Stringfellow’s, 91 NY2d at 395.) These land use regulations generally carry a strong presumption of constitutionality under state police power. (Id. at 395-396.) However, municipal zoning authority is not unfettered. The court must “consider the intertwined constitutional values of free expression” when it evaluates the 2001 amendments. (Id. at 396.)
Regulations that restrain speech or expression are unconstitutional if they are aimed at the content of the speech, and are not a proper attempt to regulate its time, place, and manner. (Renton v Playtime Theatres, 475 US 41, 47 [1986].) A municipality can regulate constitutionally protected speech and expression through the zoning power if
“(1) the ‘predominant purpose’ of the ordinance is not to control the content of the material purveyed but to control the ‘secondary effects’ of such uses on the surrounding community, (2) the ordinance is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest, (3) it is narrowly tailored to affect the category of uses that produce the unwanted effects and (4) it allows for reasonable alternative avenues of expression.” (Town of Islip v Caviglia, 73 NY2d 544, 552 [1989], citing Renton v Playtime Theatres, 475 US 41 [1986].)
New York applies a similar test to determine whether a municipal ordinance unconstitutionally infringes on the freedom of speech protections under article I, § 8 of the NY Constitution. In evaluating a municipal ordinance under article I, § 8, a court must consider whether the regulation (1) is “justified by concerns unrelated to speech,” (2) is “no broader than needed to achieve its purpose,” and (3) causes the total number of the particular adult establishments to “decline or [leads to] fewer potential customers . . . conveniently patronizing] them.” (String fellow’s, 91 NY2d at 397.) The 2001 amendments must be constitutional under both the First Amendment and article I, § 8 to survive. (Town of Islip, 73 NY2d at 556.) Because the 2001 amendments regulate constitutionally protected expression, the City must make an evidentiary showing, such as studies, data, or statistics, that there is a rational basis for the zoning ordinance. (City of Los Angeles v Alameda Books, Inc., 535 US 425, 438 [2002]; Stringfellow’s, 91 NY2d at 399-400; Town of Islip, 73 NY2d at 554.) In City of Los Angeles (535 US at 438-439 [2002]), the Supreme Court held that
“a municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial government interest. This is not to say that a municipality can get away with shoddy data or reasoning. The municipality’s evidence must fairly support the rationale for its ordinance ... If plaintiffs succeed in casting doubt on a municipality’s rationale . . . either by demonstrating that the municipality’s evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the municipality’s factual findings . . . the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.” (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.)
The primary argument of the summary judgment motion revolves around whether the City has made the requisite evidentiary showing. According to the City, the 1993 DCP Report establishes that adult establishments produce negative secondary effects. Defendants argue that the adult establishments affect the surrounding areas by reducing the quality of life, lowering property values, affecting public health, safety, and welfare, which leads to an increase in crime. Defendants assert that the 60/40s are still adult in nature and do not rectify the negative secondary effects associated with the adult establishments studied in the 1993 DCP Report. The 2001 amendments merely clarify the scope of the 1995 Resolution. According to plaintiffs, the City provides no evidence that 60/40 establishments produce any of these secondary effects. Because the 1993 DCP Report, upon which the City relies, only studied adult establishments before the 1995 Resolution, the Resolution did not examine the effects of the 60/40s. Plaintiffs argue that the 1995 Resolution was narrowly tailored to remedy the secondary effects and the City cannot argue that there is a rational basis for the 2001 amendments without evidence showing that 60/40s continue producing negative effects.
This court holds that defendants may not rely on the 1993 DCP Report as the basis for the 2001 amendments. The 1993 DCP Report did not study 60/40s, and it cannot be used as evidence to demonstrate that these establishments cause secondary effects. A study would reveal whether the 60/40 rule remedied the adverse secondary problems described in the 1993 DCP Report or whether a broader law is necessary. Furthermore, plaintiff has presented data of its own demonstrating that 60/ 40s do not cause the secondary effect of increased crime. (Ten’s Cabaret, exhibit D, Feb. 2001 police report.) Thus, defendants have not met their burden under the First Amendment. For the same reason, defendants have not shown that the 2001 amendments are “justified by concerns unrelated to speech.” (Stringfellow’s, 91 NY2d at 397.) Accordingly, the 2001 amendments fail to meet the New York State constitutional requirements of article I, § 8. While New York courts have “long recognized the considerable authority of municipalities to implement zoning plans and programs to meet the increasing encroachments of urbanization,” if an ordinance, as here, aims to curb adult uses then it implicates speech or conduct protected under both the First Amendment and by article I, § 8 of the New York State Constitution and must be held to stricter scrutiny. (Stringfellow’s, 91 NY2d at 395-396.)
Stringfellow’s upheld the 1995 Resolution because it was not a “purposeful attempt to regulate speech” and was narrowly tailored to address the secondary effects caused by adult establishments. (Id. at 397, 400.) “Based upon [the City’s] extensive analysis [in the 1993 DCP Report] of the impacts of such establishments in the City, the amendments represent a coherent regulatory scheme designed to attack the problems associated with adult establishments.” (Id. [emphasis added].) In City of New York v Dezer Props. (95 NY2d 771, 772 [2000]), the Court of Appeals further clarified that the 1995 Resolution applied to “substantial portion adult establishments.” (Id. at 772, citing Resolution; see, supra at 3 [containing text of this provision].)
In light of Stringfellow’s, the City again attempts to rely on the same 1993 DCP Report to support the 2001 amendments and grant summary judgment in its favor. As plaintiffs assert, this argument misinterprets the Stringfellow’s decision because the 60/40s did not exist when the 1993 DCP Report came out. Thus, it cannot be the basis for the 2001 amendments, which place restrictions on these new establishments. The City of New York concedes that it has not performed any subsequent study incorporating the 60/40s. In addition, there is no showing that the studies from other localities upon which defendants rely explored this type of establishment. Thus, as a matter of law, defendants have not demonstrated that there is a rational basis for the additional restrictions in the 2001 amendments. (See Chiasson v New York City Dept. of Consumer Affairs, 138 Misc 2d 394, 397 [Sup Ct, NY County 1988] [defendant, which did not provide studies or evidence showing connection between number of musicians and automotive or pedestrian traffic, failed to meet its burden].)
Defendants counter that the 1995 Resolution was never intended to provide an exception for establishments with less than a substantial portion for adult uses. Instead, it was meant to apply to all establishments that have any type of adult use. Thus, the 2001 amendments simply clarify this fact. Moreover, the original 1993 DCP Report can also be used as evidentiary support for the newest amendments. However, this argument is weak. First, it is belied by a plain reading of the 1995 Resolution, which expressly uses the phrase “substantial portion” in referring to adult establishments. Second, the Court of Appeals upheld this reading of the statute in Dezer Props. (95 NY2d 771, 773 [2000]). Third, the City of New York itself has documented in a Department of Buildings report that the statute was meant only to apply to substantial portion adult establishments. (In particular, Department of Buildings Operations Policy and Procedure Notice No. 6/98 states that “the Zoning Resolution defines an adult establishment as an establishment, a ‘substantial portion’ of which is occupied by an adult book store, adult eating or drinking establishment, adult theater, or ‘other adult commercial establishment’ see also CPC Report, Sept. 18, 1995, at 50 [discussing substantial portion language as it applies to adult establishments].)
Even if this court accepted defendants’ argument that the 2001 amendments simply clarify the 1995 Resolution by broadening the scope of its application, it would still find that the City has not satisfied its burden. As discussed above (supra), the City is constitutionally required to provide evidence showing that the 6Q/40s did not remedy the secondary effects. (See Stringfellow’s, 91 NY2d at 399-400; see also Chiasson, 138 Misc 2d at 397 [regulation must be “narrowly drawn” to advance a “compelling state interest”].) Thus, new evidence is necessary not only to demonstrate a rational basis for the 2001 amendments, but to show that the 60/40s are not the appropriately narrow solution to remedy the secondary effects illuminated in the 1993 DCP Report. (See People ex rel. Arcara v Cloud Books, 68 NY2d 553, 558-559 [1986] [regulation must be no broader than necessary to achieve purpose].) The First Amendment and article I, § 8 require a zoning ordinance to be “narrowly tailored to affect only those uses shown to produce the unwanted secondary effects,” and “no broader than needed to achieve its purpose.” (Stringfellow’s, 91 NY2d at 396-397.) The 1995 Resolution, which placed zoning restrictions on adult establishments, was the narrowly tailored solution “to affect only those uses shown to produce unwanted secondary effects” by the 1993 DCP Report. {Id. at 396.) Defendants present no evidence that link 60/40s to negative secondary effects. Also, the City has not examined how neighborhoods have changed since the creation of 60/40s. Thus, they do not demonstrate that a broader solution is necessary.
Defendants also argue that in City of Los Angeles v Alameda Books, Inc. (535 US 425 [2002]), the Supreme Court upheld an amendment to a Los Angeles zoning ordinance even though the City relied entirely on the study that was the basis of a primary ordinance. However, in that case, both the primary ordinance and its amendments regulated the same type of establishment. Here, on the other hand, in response to the original Resolution, adult establishments, including plaintiff, altered their businesses. Thus, unlike the adult businesses in City of Los Angeles, 60/40s here are different in character from the establishments the 1995 Resolution affected. Defendants cannot rely on studies that did not examine the 60/40s and expect this court to allow them to enlarge the scope of the 1995 Resolution. (See Chiasson, 138 Misc 2d at 396.)
In further support of its motion, plaintiff asserts that defendants’ affirmative defenses of collateral estoppel and laches hold no merit. The doctrine of collateral estoppel bars a party from litigating an issue if (1) that issue has been decided in a prior proceeding, (2) it was necessary to the judgment, and (3) the litigant had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding. (Capital Tel. Co. v Pattersonville Tel. Co., 56 NY2d 11 [1982].) According to defendants, collateral estoppel applies here based on Stringfellow’s (91 NY2d 382 [1998]) in which the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against Ten’s Cabaret in its challenge of the 1995 Resolution. However, as plaintiff argues, Stringfellow’s solely dealt with the constitutionality of the 1995 Resolution as it applies to adult establishments. However, the present action concerns the new 2001 amendments, and their application to 60/40 establishments. Neither the 60/40 establishments, nor the 2001 amendments were in existence in 1998, and plaintiff could not possibly have included them in the Stringfellow’s action. Plaintiff could not have raised the issue, as it did not exist. The City defined adult establishment differently to the Court, and plaintiff responded to that definition. The argument whether the City could broaden the scope of the 1995 Resolution could not have been made before there was any attempt to broaden it. Therefore, collateral estoppel does not apply. (See Matter of Massa v City of Kingston, 284 AD2d 836, 840 [3d Dept 2001] [holding that collateral estoppel does not preclude issues that “were not raised and could not have been raised” in prior action].)
Additionally, defendants assert that plaintiffs should be barred from bringing its motion for a preliminary injunction based on laches. To have a successful laches defense, a party must demonstrate
“(1) conduct by an offending party giving rise to the situation complained of,
“(2) delay by the complainant asserting his or her claim for relief despite the opportunity to do so,
“(3) lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the offending party that the complainant would assert his or her claim for relief, and
“(4) injury or prejudice to the offending party in the event that relief is accorded the complainant.” (Dwyer v Mazzola, 171 AD2d 726, 727 [2d Dept 1991].)
Defendants argue that plaintiff waited too long before bringing its motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants contend that this hesitation prejudiced the City by delaying the enforcement of the 2001 amendments, and causing the surrounding communities to continue to suffer from the alleged secondary effects caused by plaintiffs business. Plaintiff argues that it did not wait too long before it brought this motion, and any delay was a result of defendants’ actions.
Plaintiffs actions did not constitute a negligent delay. Here, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction one month before the 2001 amendments were to be enforced. (See id.) In any event, because this court is granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction is moot. Thus, the laches argument is also moot.
Where the issues of fact are undisputed, and it is established that a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment must be granted. (CPLR 3212; Dougherty v Kinard, 215 AD2d 521, 522 [2d Dept 1995].) Thus, the court grants plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denies defendants’ cross motion for summary judgment. As plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction is now moot, the court does not address it.
Defendants do not oppose the motion for consolidation, neither does Ten’s. “When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before a court, the court, upon motion, may order . . . the actions consolidated.” (CPLR 602 [a].)
The court holds that consolidation is appropriate because both actions deal with most, if not all, of the same questions of law and fact (see CPLR 602 [a]) and would save unnecessary costs, time and prevent inconsistency of decisions. (Chinatown Apts. v New York City Tr. Auth., 100 AD2d 824, 825 [1st Dept 1984].) Both actions challenge the constitutional validity of the 2001 amendments, and the plaintiffs in both actions are 60/40 establishments. In fact, the two complaints are almost identical.
Defendants rely on their papers in Ten’s for their cross motion for summary judgment, and for their opposition to plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The court searches the record pursuant to CPLR 3212 (b) and grants summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Pussycat. Because defendants have moved for summary judgment, the court can grant summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, who have not moved for this relief for the same reasons as summary judgment was granted in Ten’s. (See Goldstein v County of Suffolk, 300 AD2d 441, 442 [2d Dept 2002].)
In summary: (1) Pussycat is to be consolidated with Ten’s, and summary judgment is granted to plaintiffs, and defendants’ cross motion for summary judgment is denied. (2) Plaintiffs are awarded costs and disbursements. There should be one bill of costs for the consolidated action.
The cities studied in the 1993 DCP Report include Boston, Phoenix, Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta, Kansas City, Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Long Island communities of Islip, Brookhaven, Smithtown, Babylon, and Huntington.",0
0482-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
James C. Harberson, J.
Facts
The defendant was charged with operating her vehicle on May 29, 2003 in the City of Watertown without wearing a seat belt under Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (3-a).
Officer Charles Donoghue stated in his supporting deposition of June 1, 2003 that he “saw that the defendant was wearing the lap portion of the seatbelt, but the shoulder strap was going under the defendant’s left arm and across her abdominal area.” He said the defendant told him she wore the seat belt in that manner “because the seatbelt bothers her neck.” Officer Donoghue concluded “[S]he was cited for improper wear [sic] of her seatbelt.” Officer Donoghue wrote on the simplified traffic information at the space titled description of violation “no seat-belt — driver (not properly worn)” and listed the violation under Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (3-a).
The defendant appeared in court on June 5, 2003 and objected to the ticket because she felt she had complied with the law in the manner she wore the seat belt strap under her arm rather than over her shoulder.
Decision
In 2002 the Legislature enacted Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (3-a) (L 2002, ch 546, § 1) in response to two decisions: People v Widrick (185 Misc 2d 765 [2000]) and People v Cucinello (183 Misc 2d 50 [1999]).
Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (3-a) states that “it shall be a violation of this section if a person is seated in a seating position equipped with both a lap safety belt and a shoulder harness belt and such person is not restrained by both such lap safety belt and shoulder harness belt.” It is noted Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (1), (2) and (3) all refer to a vehicle occupant being “restrained” by a safety seat or seat belt.
Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (1) requires all children under the age of four to be “restrained in a specially designed seat” and Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (7) exempts from seat belt use one “whose physical disability would prevent appropriate restraint in such safety seat or safety belt provided.”
In People v Widrick this court pointed out that some drivers “elected to use the shoulder harness safety belt in a fashion that was comfortable for them by placing it under their arm” (id. at 771). This court went on to say that “[t]hese practices of the defendants reflect the same choice many people make because the ‘one size fits all’ shoulder harness strap based on a person’s physical characteristics either crosses over the neck, throat, or cheek and/or under the chin, or fits so snugly that it is too tight to be comfortable, or so loosely that the shoulder harness safety belt hangs free leaving a gap between the person and the shoulder strap, [and] [t]he normal reaction of an American citizen is to reheve the discomfort of the shoulder harness safety belt strap by crossing it under the arm” (id. at 771).
One of the “one size fits all” drawbacks was the subject of an article in the Watertown Daily Times on July 28, 2003 addressing the need for the use of booster seats for those not required to be placed in child safety seats: “[c]ar seats belts are designed to fit the average adult man. When you place a child in an adult belt, the shoulder portion hits the child’s face or neck and the lap portion rides over his abdomen” (id. at 38, col 1). The article refers to a June 2003 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The authors of the JAMA report stated that “the objective of this study was to assess the relative effectiveness of belt-positioning booster seats compared with seat belts alone in reducing risk of injury to children 4 to 7 years of age.” (Durbin, Elliott and Winston, Belt-Positioning Booster Seats and Reduction in Risk of Injury Among Children in Vehicle Crashes, 289 JAMA 2835 [2003].)
The JAMA report said that the consequence of this poor positioning of the seat belt over a child four to seven years of age is injuries to the child’s “intra-abdominal [area] and spinal cord injuries, also known as the ‘seat belt syndrome’ ” (id.) when there is an accident.
In this case the issue is whether the driver who placed the upper strap under her arm violated Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c (3-a). The statute clearly states a violation of the section occurs when “a person is seated in a seating position equipped with both a lap safety belt and a shoulder harness belt and such person is not restrained by both such lap safety belt and shoulder harness belt.”
As “Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1229-c [(3-a)] is an act which is malum prohibitum being a regulatory law” (Widrick at 769) and “[a]s it is now worded the statute fails in its wording to give an ‘unequivocal warning’ that the defendant [’s] conduct not malum in se violates [section 1229-c (3-a) of] the Vehicle and Traffic Law (Matter of Asheroff v Parking Violations Bur., 38 AD2d 474, 477 [1972], supra)” (People v Widrick, supra at 771), the court finds that the defendant’s placement of the top belt under her arm so long as it crosses over the front of her torso and is connected “such person is restrained by both such lap . . . and shoulder . . . belt.” This is because the plain wording of the statute required her to be “restrained” by both belts, not that the top belt be placed over or under her arm. In either location, once this top belt is secured it will “restrain” the upper body of the person wearing it.
In fact, when the top belt is placed under the arm then all persons so secured are equally protected. This would not be the case of people at either end of the height spectrum where the length of their torso results in these “one size fits all” top belts either crossing too high above the shoulder (short stature) or too low so as to cross below it over the upper arm of those of a tall stature.
The goal of seat belts is to protect one from injuries if there is an accident and it is clear that the use of seat belts that restrain the user is all the statute requires. The officer’s conclusion that a seat belt must be worn “over the shoulder” to be “properly worn” to comply with the statute is not supported by the wording of the statute nor with the fact that in the case of child users four to seven the “over the shoulder” position of the belt which causes it to run over their “face or neck” fails to protect them in the case of an accident according to the JAMA report.
If the top portion of the seat belt should be worn “over the shoulder” to comply with the law which now only requires it to be worn so a person is “restrained” by both the lap and shoulder belt, to comply with the clear wording of the statute the Legislature should so word the statute to say where the top belt should be placed to restrain the user to prevent the injuries the belts were designed to protect against. It is clear that “over the shoulder” position does not do this in children ages four to seven nor could it in the case of people too short or too tall for the top strap to cross over the same shoulder area where it might on the “average adult male.”
It is incumbent upon the Legislature to reword the statute to make it certain whether the top belt should be worn over the shoulder or under it (under the arm) to properly comply with the statutory mandate so as to “provide sufficient notice of what conduct is prohibited [and] second . . . not [to] be written in such a manner as to permit or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” (People v Bright, 71 NY2d 376, 382 [1988].)
In this case the lack of wording in the statute to indicate whether the top strap should be worn over or under the shoulder — under the arm — fails “ ‘to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that [her] . . . conduct is forbidden by the statute’ ” {id. at 383-384) and provides “objective standards to guide those enforcing the laws [so as not to allow] police to make arrests based upon their own personal, subjective idea of right and wrong” (id. at 383).
The charge against the defendant is dismissed.",0
0531-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
John M. Leventhal, J.
In American jurisprudence, an acquittal of criminal charges does not signify that the acquitee did not actually commit the crime (United States v Watts, 519 US 148, 155 [1997]; People v Horne, 97 NY2d 404, 413 [2002]). A “not guilty” verdict indicates that the government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed one of the elements of a crime (id.; see also People ex rel. Matthews v New York State Div. of Parole, 58 NY2d 196, 203 [1983]). Conversely, a “guilty” verdict only indicates that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed each and every element of the crime, and not that the defendant actually committed the crime (see People v Goetz, 73 NY2d 751, 752 [1988]). The issue in this case is what is a court’s role when a claim is made in a motion to vacate a judgment that the defendant did not commit the crime, although the defendant’s conviction was constitutionally and properly obtained (freestanding claim of innocence). Is the court the proper branch of government in which to raise a claim of factual innocence? If the court is the appropriate forum, what is the legal basis for the innocence claim? What criteria should a court use in determining, postjudgment, the actual innocence of a defendant? If the court finds that a convicted person is in fact innocent, what is the appropriate remedy?
In deciding this motion to vacate the judgment, the court has considered the moving papers and all responsive papers, the trial record, the hearing testimony, the oral arguments, defendant’s document dated March 3, 2003 entitled “Defendant’s Summation” and the People’s posthearing memorandum of law.
Background
On August 4, 1985 at approximately 1:00 p.m. near the corner of Fulton Street and Spencer Place, Brooklyn, New York, a man was shot. The police investigated the shooting and were told by various witnesses, including a Mr. Fleming, the name of the shooter. Mr. Fleming chose a photograph of a person who was incarcerated at the time of the shooting. Other witnesses identified other persons whom the investigation ruled out.
On February 1, 1986, one Jeffrey Campbell, while in jail on a pending unrelated case, named the defendant as the shooter. Subsequently, another eyewitness identified the defendant at a photographic identification procedure and a lineup.
On February 27, 1986, the instant indictment was filed charging the defendant with murder in the second degree and related charges. Prior to the filing of the indictment, both Mr. Fleming and the defendant testified during the grand jury presentation that the defendant was not the shooter.
On March 11, 1986, the defendant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty.
On March 17, 1987, a jury trial commenced. The People presented the testimony of Mr. Campbell and another eyewitness. Both of these witnesses identified the defendant as the shooter. The defendant presented a different eyewitness who knew the defendant and testified that the defendant was not the shooter. The defendant also called an alibi witness to testify that the defendant was at a location other than the scene of the crime at the time of the shooting. Neither Mr. Fleming nor the defendant testified at trial.
On March 23, 1987, the jury convicted the defendant of manslaughter in the first degree and related charges.
On August 7, 1987, the defendant was sentenced. His sentence was to run consecutive to his Manhattan 6 years to life sentence.
By order dated September 12, 2002 (NYLJ, Sept. 20, 2002, at 20, col 4), the court directed a hearing regarding the newly discovered evidence claim raised in defendant’s papers. The court also directed that the hearing include possible Brady violations and a free-standing claim of innocence.
At the hearing the defendant called four alleged eyewitnesses who testified that they saw the shooting and that the defendant was not the shooter. All four alleged eyewitnesses identified a person by the name of “Denzel” as the shooter. All four of the eyewitnesses have extensive criminal records. The defendant also presented an audiotape and a videotape of the recantation of Jeffrey Campbell.
CPL 440,10
Except where authorized by law, the “adjudicatory power of the criminal court end[s] with the imposition of a sentence” (People v Stevens, 91 NY2d 270, 277 [1998]). Thus, the power of a court to set aside a verdict is “created and measured by the statute” (People v Schmidt, 216 NY 324, 328 [1915]; see also People v Jackson, 78 NY2d 638, 647 [1991]). A lower court has no inherent power to set aside a guilty verdict (People v Carter, 63 NY2d 530, 537-538 [1984]; People ex rel. Jerome v Court of General Sessions, 185 NY 504, 506-507 [1906]; see also People v Rao, 271 NY 98, 100-101 [1936]), but is limited to those grounds enumerated by statute and their statutory criteria (People v Reyati, 254 AD2d 199, 200 [1998]; People v Forbes, 191 Misc 2d 573, 576 [2002]; see also Jackson, 78 NY2d at 647; Schmidt, 216 NY 328; People v Salemi, 309 NY 208, 215 [1955]). There exists no authority to vacate a judgment in the interest of justice or on equity grounds (People v Forbes, 191 Misc 2d at 576 [see cases cited therein]; see People v Hawkins, 99 NY2d 592, 593 [2003]).
Newly Discovered Evidence
The power to grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence is purely statutory (Salemi, 309 NY at 215; People v Pugh, 236 AD2d 810, 811 [1997]; People v Latella, 112 AD2d 321, 322 [1985]). This power cannot be exercised unless all the requirements of the statute have been met (id.; People v Taylor, 246 AD2d 410, 411 [1998]; People v Balan, 107 AD2d 811, 815 [1985]). Whether the criteria have been met rests in the sound discretion of the court (id.). This discretion has been described as “unlimited” (People v Baxley, 84 NY2d 208, 212 [1994]; People v Crimmins, 38 NY2d 407, 415 [1975]).
The six Salemi (309 NY at 216) requirements for all newly discovered evidence claims are:
“1. It must be such as will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; 2. It must have been discovered since the trial; 3. It must be such as could have not been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence; 4. It must be material to the issue; 5. It must not be cumulative to the former issue; and, 6. It must not be merely impeaching or contradicting the former evidence.”
The “it” refers to the newly discovered evidence. The newly discovered evidence must be evidence admissible at trial (People v Boyette, 201 AD2d 490, 491 [1994]; People v Dabbs, 154 Misc 2d 671, 674 [1991]; see also People v Fields, 66 NY2d 876, 877 [1985]).
In this case, the audiotape and videotape of Mr. Campbell’s alleged recantation and the statement by Mr. Fleming do not constitute newly discovered evidence.
The court finds that the defendant has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the uncalled eyewitnesses could not have been discovered prior to trial with due diligence. In this regard, the court notes that defendant was aware that other eyewitnesses had selected other persons as the perpetrator.
The motion as it relates to newly discovered evidence is denied.
Brady
The State has a duty to disclose exculpatory evidence in its possession which is material to the guilt or innocence of the defendant (Brady v Maryland, 373 US 83 [1963]; People v Vilardi, 76 NY2d 67, 73 [1990]). A defendant making a postconviction Brady claim must establish that the material was not known to the defense (see People v Fein, 18 NY2d 162, 169-170 [1966]; People v Rodriguez, 223 AD2d 605, 606 [1996]; People v Ausserau, 77 AD2d 152, 156 [1980]). Also, movant must show that the material was never disclosed to him/her (People v Licitra, 236 AD2d 559 [1997]).
The People have no obligation to supply a defendant with material that the defendant knew or should have known existed and knew or should have known was exculpatory (People v Doshi, 93 NY2d 499, 506 [1999]; Fein, 18 NY2d 162 [1966]).
Where a defendant has made a specific request for a particular item of evidence, a court judges the materiality of the evidence by whether there is a reasonable possibility that the failure to disclose the item affected the verdict (Brady, 373 US at 88; Vilardi, 76 NY2d at 73). If a defendant makes a general or nonspecific request for exculpatory evidence, the failure to disclose such material is a due process violation only if there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial was affected (United States v Agurs, 427 US 97, 112 [1976]; Vilardi, 76 NY2d at 73; People v Smith, 63 NY2d 41, 67 [1984]; People v Nedrick, 166 AD2d 725, 727 [1990]).
Although several of the witnesses testified that they informed the police of the innocence of the defendant, the court finds such testimony unworthy of belief. The testimony is contradicted by documentary evidence and the testimony of the investigating police officers.
The court finds that the defendant has failed to prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the State possessed exculpatory evidence that was not turned over to the defense.
The defendant has also failed to show that he did not know of the exculpatory information. Some of the witnesses stated that prior to trial they informed the defendant or his brother {see n 6 herein).
The motion as it relates to the Brady issue is denied.
The question now arises whether there is a provision in CPL article 440 that authorizes the court to vacate the judgment based on a free-standing claim of innocence. The issue distills to whether the conviction or incarceration of a factually innocent person is a violation of the New York State Constitution. If the conviction or incarceration does violate the State Constitution then CPL 440.10 (1) (h) provides a basis for vacating the judgment.
Separation of Powers
Both the United States Constitution (art II, § 2 [1]) and the New York State Constitution (art iy § 4) accord the chief executive officer of government the right to grant clemency or a pardon to a convicted person. As pointed out by Chief Justice Rehnquist in Herrera v Collins (506 US 390, 411-417 [1993]), executive clemency has been the traditional “fail safe” (at 415) for postjudgment claims that a defendant is innocent. The Chief Justice, writing the lead opinion in Herrera, held that as long as a state provides for a mechanism through the executive branch of government for entertaining a claim of innocence, no federal procedural due process violation occurs by the incarceration of or the execution of a factually innocent individual.
Dicta in three old New York Court of Appeals decisions support Chief Justice Rehnquist’s rationale (People ex rel. Prisament v Brophy, 287 NY 132, 139 [1941]; People ex rel. Hirschberg v Orange County, 271 NY 151, 156 [1936]; People v Broncado, 188 NY 150, 155-156 [1907]). As stated in dicta in People ex rel. Prisament (287 NY at 139):
“Under an ideal system of administration of justice a person convicted of a crime should, perhaps, be granted an opportunity to present to a court proof of his innocence whenever such proof becomes available and, then, to ask the court to vacate the erroneous judgment. In practice, inflexible rules of procedure may deny to a person wrongfully convicted any further access to the court. Then his only means of redress is appeal to the executive.”
The dicta in the above-noted cases would bar a court from vacating a judgment based on factual innocence.
The rationale of two New York Court of Appeals decisions contradict Chief Justice Rehnquist’s position and the dicta in the above-noted cases (People ex rel. Sloane v Lawes, 255 NY 112, 118-119 [1930]; Matter of Kaufmann, 245 NY 423, 430 [1927]). In Matter of Kaufmann (245 NY at 430), the Court stated
“Rare instances may arise, however, where one convicted, disbarred and pardoned may be able to satisfy the court that his guilt has not been proved or even to go farther and demonstrate his innocence. In these exceptional conditions, the administration of justice would be subject to reproach if an implacable law of remedies were to close the door forever upon the hope of vindication.”
It must be remembered that under the New York State Constitution a pardon based on actual innocence does not constitute a nullification of the conviction, and the conviction remains intact (Lyons v Goldstein, 290 NY 19, 27 [1943]; People ex rel. Prisament, 287 NY at 138-139; Roberts v State of New York, 160 NY 217, 221 [1899]; see also Annotation, 97 ALR5th 293). This is true because the executive branch of government cannot effect a judgment rendered by the judicial branch of government (id.).
The court is aware that Executive Law § 19 provides that where a convicted person has been pardoned based upon innocence and a motion to vacate the judgment based upon newly discovered evidence would be untimely, then such individual may apply to the court to vacate the conviction and the court must grant the motion. This statute is antiquated and inapplicable under current law, as there is no current legal time bar to a motion to vacate a judgment based upon newly discovered evidence. The statute recognizes that it is the court that vacates the conviction, and that the court has a function in such a situation, albeit ministerial.
The inadequacy of the pardon as a remedy for wrongfully convicted individuals has been pointed out by the Court of Appeals (Lyons, 290 NY at 27) and legal scholars (Pietrkowski, The Diffusion of Due Process in Capital Cases of Actual Innocence, after Herrera, 70 Chi-Kent L Rev 1391, 1426-1427; Reinmuth, When Actual Innocence is Irrelevant: Federal Habeas Relief for State Prisoners after Herrera v. Collins, 69 Wash L Rev 279, 298; Bandes, Simple Murder: A Comment on the Legality of Executing the Innocent, 44 Buff L Rev 501, 520-522; Klasmeier, Towards a New Understanding of Capital Clemency and Procedural Due Process, 75 BU L Rev 1507). The criticisms center upon the fact that a pardon is dispensed based upon the mercy of the executive. There is nothing compelling the governor to grant a pardon to an actually innocent defendant. Often pardons are denied based on arbitrary criteria, political considerations, lack of resources to investigate the claim, fulfillment of campaign promises and the character of the innocent individual (id.). One study shows that pardons or clemency is not always granted to factually innocent persons (69 Wash L Rev at 298).
Not all these criticisms are valid in New York. An examination of the Guidelines for Review of Executive Clemency Applications (reprinted following McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 18, Executive Law § 15) shows the following criteria:
“Pardon is most commonly available:
“(1) to permit a judgment of conviction to be set aside where there is overwhelming and convincing proof of innocence not available at the time of conviction.”
Thus, there are criteria in New York for executive pardon based on factual innocence.
Also, the court notes that the Kangs County District Attorney has established a section of the office to examine claims of actual innocence. Indeed, the court is aware of several cases in this county where the prosecution has requested the court to vacate a conviction based upon what was later determined to be an unjustified conviction of a defendant. Although the District Attorney is an executive officer, the motion to vacate is made to the court and not to the governor for a pardon.
However, this court has been unable to locate any case that discusses whether under the New York State Constitution it is unconstitutional to convict and to incarcerate a guiltless person. In this regard it is a judicial function to determine whether the New York State Constitution bars the conviction or the jailing of an actually innocent individual. It is a judicial function to vacate a court judgment which violates the Constitution (In re Opinion of Justices, 234 Mass 612, 127 NE 635, 639 [1920]; State v Stern, 210 Minn 107, 297 NW 321, 323 [1941]).
The court must now consider whether the New York State Constitution bars the conviction and continued incarceration of a guiltless person.
Federal Constitution and Other States
The United States Supreme Court has refused to hold that it is improper for a state to incarcerate an innocent person, provided that the state provides for a possibility of a pardon based upon the person being innocent (Herrera, 506 US at 399-400). In Herrera (at 400) the lead opinion held that “claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have never been held to state a ground for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation occurring in the underlying state criminal proceeding.” Under the federal system, a state prisoner’s claim of innocence by itself is not a sufficient ground for granting of habeas corpus relief, but permits the federal courts to overlook procedural grounds barring other federal constitutional claims (Schlup v Delo, 513 US 298 [1995]). Virtually every United States Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the refusal by the United States Supreme Court to hold that a claim of actual innocence is grounds for relief means that there exists no constitutional prohibition against leaving an innocent person in jail if the state provides for a pardon based upon innocence (Royal v Taylor, 188 F3d 239, 243 [1999]; Sellers v Ward, 135 F3d 1333, 1338-1339 [1998]; Lucas v Johnson, 132 F3d 1069, 1075-1077 [1998]; Meadows v Delo, 99 F3d 280, 283 [1996]; Milone v Camp, 22 F3d 693, 705-706 [1994]).
New York provides for the pardon of an actually innocent defendant {see Executive Law § 19; see also People v Chichester, 162 Misc 2d 658, 659 [1994]). Thus, the incarceration of an actual innocent person in New York would not violate the Federal Constitution.
Many states have similarly held that a free-standing claim of actual innocence is insufficient to provide for postconviction relief (State v Byrd, 145 Ohio App 3d 318, 323, 710 NE2d 1043, 1053-1054 [2001]; Reedy v Wright, 2002 WL 598434, 2002 Va Cir LEXIS 64 [Va Cir Ct, Apr. 8, 2002]; State v Ratliff, 71 SW3d 291, 296-298 [Tenn 2001]; State v Placzkiewicz, 307 Mont 189, 192, 36 P3d 934, 936 [2001]; State v Norsworthy, 71 SW3d 610 [Mo 2002]; Pellegrini v State, 117 Nev 860, 34 P3d 519, 537 [2001]; Heffernan v State, 2002 WL 1303388, 2002 Ark LEXIS 363 [Ark Cir Ct, June 13, 2002]). These jurisdictions hold that a free-standing showing of actual innocence will overcome procedural bars to claims other than actual innocence.
Several states hold that the conviction or incarceration of an actually innocent defendant is either unconstitutional or is, in and of itself, sufficient to vacate a conviction (People v Washing ton, 171 Ill 2d 475, 665 NE2d 1330 [1996]; Miller v Commissioner of Correction, 242 Conn 745, 700 A2d 1108 [1997]; In re Clark, 5 Cal 4th 750, 855 P2d 729 [1993]; Ex parte Elizondo, 947 SW2d 202 [Tex 1996]; State ex rel. Amrine v Roper, 102 SW3d 541 [Mo 2003]).
New York State Constitution
The New York State Constitution grants an accused greater rights than those provided in the Federal Constitution (see People v Harris, 77 NY2d 434 [1991]; People v Class, 67 NY2d 431, 433 [1986]; see generally People v P.J. Video, 68 NY2d 296 [1986]). These constitutional rights were granted to an accused in order to protect an innocent person from improper conviction (see People v Malinski, 292 NY 360, 383 [1944] [Lehman, J., dissenting]). New York has accorded an accused broader rights to counsel than the Federal Constitution in order to insure that “the innocent go free” (People v Claudio, 83 NY2d 76, 79 [1993]). The New York State Constitution provides for indictment by a grand jury in order to protect an innocent suspect from false accusation (People v Infante, 124 AD2d 86, 90 [1987]). The constitutional right to be present at trial is for the “protection of the innocent” (People v Mullen, 44 NY2d 1, 4 [1978]). The constitutional bar against the introduction of suggestive procedure is to diminish “the risk of convicting the innocent through tainted identification procedures” (People v Gee, 99 NY2d 158, 162 [2002]).
Our Court of Appeals has recognized that the function of a criminal prosecution and the interest of society is to convict the guilty and to acquit the innocent (People v Roselle, 84 NY2d 350, 356 [1994]).
It is clear from the above that one of the goals of the New York Constitution is to insure that the guiltless are acquitted. Not only are procedures to achieve a goal part of the Constitution, but those goals are considered by this court as essential parts of the Constitution. Thus, the ends of acquitting the non-guilty is an essential part of the Constitution.
Article I, § 6 of the New York Constitution prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law. The concept of due process requires that the government grant “elemental fairness” to an accused (Vilardi, 76 NY2d at 76). Further, a person who has not committed any crime has a liberty interest in remaining free from punishment. This court holds that the conviction or incarceration of a guiltless person violates elemental fairness, deprives that person of freedom of movement and freedom from punishment and thus runs afoul of the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution.
Article I, § 5 of the New York Constitution prohibits the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment. This prohibits punishing a person disproportionately to the crime committed (People v Broadie, 37 NY2d 100, 111 [1975]). The court.finds that punishing an actually innocent person is disproportionate to the crime (or lack of crime) committed and violates the cruel and inhuman treatment clause.
Whatever the rubric used, the court finds that the conviction of and/or punishment imposed upon an innocent person violates the New York State Constitution.
CPL 440.10 (1) (h) provides for the vacating of a judgment which was obtained in violation of an accused’s constitutional rights.
Standard for Determining Actual Innocence
The function of a standard of proof is to instruct the fact-finder “concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks . . . should [be had] in the correctness of [the] factual conclusion [ ]” (People v Geraci, 85 NY2d 359, 367 [1995]; Matter of Storar, 52 NY2d 363, 379 [1981]; see also Addington v Texas, 441 US 418, 425 [1979]; Schlup, 513 US at 325). In determining the proper standard of proof in any situation, the court must weigh the public and private interests affected and evaluate how the risk of error should be distributed (Matter of Lee TT. v Dowling, 87 NY2d 699, 712 [1996]; see also Matter of Miller v DeBuono, 90 NY2d 783, 792 [1997]).
The courts and individual judges or justices that have discussed the appropriate burden of proof for a free-standing claim of innocence have come to divergent opinions (see Herrera, 506 US 390 [1993]; Washington, 171 Ill 2d at 489, 665 NE2d at 1337; Miller, 242 Conn 745, 700 A2d 1108; In re Clark, 5 Cal 4th at 798, 855 P2d at 761; Ex parte Franklin, 72 SW3d 671, 678 [Tex 2002]; Roper, 102 SW3d at 547 [Mo]). Similarly, legal scholars who have discussed the issue have reached different conclusions (70 Chi-Kent L Rev at 1438; 69 Wash L Rev at 301). Typical of the divergent opinions are the differing opinions in Miller (242 Conn 745, 700 A2d 1108). The majority opinion in Miller sets the standard for a claim of innocence as the convicted defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is innocent and considering all the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom no reasonable factfinder would find the petitioner guilty (242 Conn at 791-792, 700 A2d at 1130-1131). Justice Berdon, concurring and dissenting, would set the standard as a showing that the petitioner is “probably innocent” (242 Conn at 813, 817, 700 A2d at 1140, 1142). Justice McDonald, in dissent, would require a showing that “unerringly demonstrates the defendant was innocent” (242 Conn at 819, 826, 700 A2d at 1143, 1146).
In Schlup (513 US at 316), the United States Supreme Court indicated that if it were to adopt a constitutional standard for a free-standing claim of innocence, it would require unquestionable evidence that the petitioner was innocent.
This court must balance the various interests and determine the proper standard of proof under the New York State Constitution. The government has an interest in the finality of a conviction once it has accorded an accused all of the constitutional rights required by law (People v Machado, 90 NY2d 187, 192 [1997]; People v Jackson, 78 NY2d 638, 646-647 [1991]; People v Seaberg, 74 NY2d 1, 10 [1989]). After a conviction has been constitutionally obtained, there is a presumption that the convicted person is in fact guilty (People v Ekinici, 191 Misc 2d 510, 518 [2002], citing Schlup at 326 n 42). Nonetheless, society does not have any interest in the conviction or punishment of an innocent person.
A person who has not committed any crime certainly has a strong interest in remaining at or returning to liberty.
Balancing the public and private interests involved and considering that the defendant has had the opportunity to prove his innocence, the court finds that a movant making a freestanding claim of innocence must establish by clear and convincing evidence (considering the trial and hearing evidence) that no reasonable juror could convict the defendant of the crimes for which the petitioner was found guilty.
In this respect, a court conducting a hearing on a claim of innocence should admit into evidence any reliable evidence whether in admissible form or not (see Bousley, 523 US at 623-624; Schlup, 513 US at 327-328; Herrera, 506 US at 443 [Blackmun, J., dissenting, joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.]). This is so because the focus is on factual innocence and not on whether the government can prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Remedy
All courts that have ruled that a petitioner may make a freestanding claim of innocence have held that if a court upholds such a claim a new trial should be ordered (see cases cited above). This court disagrees. If a court has determined by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror could convict the defendant of the charged crime, what purpose does a new trial serve? There is no reasonable juror who could convict. Thus, any juror who does convict is unreasonable. There appears to be no reason to order a new trial.
Further, if the jury convicts such a person, this second conviction would be equally unconstitutional as there exists clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror could convict the defendant.
Thus, if a court sustains a free-standing claim of innocence, the court should vacate the conviction and dismiss the accusatory instrument.
Application to this Case
In determining whether this defendant has met his burden of proof the court has considered the following:
1. The credibility of the defendant’s witnesses is questionable in light of their extensive criminal history. However, this does not make the witnesses as a matter of law incredible (People v Adams, 302 AD2d 601, 601 [2003] [and cases cited therein]).
2. This court has already found that parts of the defendant’s witnesses’ testimony is incredible in one aspect, and thus there is justification for rejecting all of their testimony (see People v Johnson, 225 AD2d 464, 464 [1996]).
3. The 16-year delay by the witnesses in claiming that the defendant is innocent affects their credibility (see People v Vasquez, 204 AD2d 114, 114-115 [1994]).
4. All the descriptions given to the police at the time of the incident do not match that of the defendant’s appearance at the time of the crime.
5. The stories of the witnesses regarding the crime are consistent with each other and with the defendant’s trial witnesses.
6. The time line testified to by the defendant’s hearing witnesses is inconsistent with documentary evidence and the testimony of the police officers called at the hearing. Some of the factual allegations made by the defendant’s hearing witnesses were contradicted by the police testimony.
7. There is evidence that the defendant or a person on his behalf (his brother) threatened and bribed certain witnesses. This is evidence of consciousness of guilt (see People v Bennett, 79 NY2d 464, 469 [1992]).
8. There was nothing about the demeanor of the defendant’s hearing witnesses that would cause the court to disbelieve their testimony (although some of the previous reasons would be grounds).
Given all the above, the court finds that the defendant has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror could convict the defendant. For the purpose of completeness and for the purpose of review should an appellate court determine that the proper applicable standard would be different, this court finds that the defendant has shown that he is probably innocent (more likely than not approximating 55%).
The motion to vacate the conviction is denied.
. Jeffrey Campbell had been originally arrested when a police officer observed him fleeing the scene. He was released based on evidence that he was not the shooter.
. The defendant is currently serving both sentences.
. Although the defendant’s original motion did not specifically address these claims, a fair reading of the papers did. The court ordered that these grounds be added to the hearing in order to give all parties an opportunity to address the legal and factual issues.
. Mr. Campbell is no longer alive.
. In some cases the Court of Appeals has stated that a lower court has the “inherent” power to set aside a judgment obtained by “fraud, misrepresentation, violation of defendant’s constitutional rights or other similar trial errors” (People v Farrell, 85 NY2d 60, 68 [1995]). These grounds have all been incorporated in CPL article 440, and thus the statute controls.
. For example, the witness Tildón Edwards stated that he had appeared before the grand jury as a defense witness and was never called. Edwards also testified that he came to court with the defendant’s brother. It is clear that defense counsel with a little diligence could have spoken to Mr. Edwards and discovered the names of the other witnesses who were present. Mr. Edwards knew all the names of the witnesses who were presented at the hearing. The witness Bertram Carter said he told the defendant while in the Brooklyn House of Detention that he knew that the defendant was not the shooter. The witness Derrell Gregory testified that he informed the defendant’s brother about his potential testimony that the defendant was not the shooter before the commencement of the trial. The testimony of the defendant’s investigator also shows that with due diligence the witnesses could have been discovered. If the investigator found these witnesses 16 years after trial, there appears to be no reason why these witnesses could not have been located at the time of the trial.
. The court finds the detectives’ testimony in this regard to be credible.
. Similar sentiments were expressed by Justice Scalia (joined by Justice Thomas) in his dissent in Bousley v United States (523 US 614, 635 [1998]).
. New York at one time did in fact place a two-year time limitation on such motions.
. This is just a sampling of the decisions in the federal court. The court is aware of the case of Carriger v Stewart (132 F3d 463 [1997]) which appears to hold to the contrary.
. This case was decided after this court’s original decision in this case.
. Since the determination in this case centers on what a reasonable juror could find, it is not necessary for the court to make a final credibility determination.
. The reason the court has put a percentage in this decision is for the purpose that should an appellate court adopt a standard between “probably innocent” and “clear and convincing,” the appellate court can apply that standard to this case without remanding the matter.",1
0829-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Timothy J. Dufficy, J.
Defendant is charged with violating Penal Law § 265.01 (1), criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1192 (3), operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and Administrative Code of the City of New York § 10-306 (d), possession of ammunition. In a motion filed on September 4, 2003, defendant seeks dismissal of count one and count three of the accusatory instrument as facially insufficient pursuant to CPL 170.30 and 170.35, and on the grounds that the accusatory instrument is defective because it fails to allege facts supporting all of the elements of the offenses charged pursuant to CPL 100.40. At the appearance on Septembbr 30, 2003 the defense expressly withdrew their challenge to the facial sufficiency of count one of the complaint criminal possession of a weapon and renewed their objection to the charge of, possession of ammunition. The court finds that the People haVe failed to state an essential element of the crime charged, in that the People fail to state the weapon is a “semiautomatic” shotgun (Penal Law § 265.00 [22] [b]). Thus, that portion of the complaint is jurisdictionally defective. (CPL 100.15 [3]; People v Alejandro, 70 NY2d 133 [1987].) An information’s failure to allege an element of the offense charged is a nonwaivable jurisdictional defect. (See, People v Casey, 95 NY2d 354 [2000].) The People have until the statutory period provided by CPL 30.30 to correct said defect. It should also be noted that when a statute contains exceptions there is case law holding that the exceptions should be pleaded within the accusatory instrument. (See, Penal Law § 265.00 [22] [e]; People v Rodriguez, 68 NY2d 674 [1986]; People v Feller, 191 Misc 2d 390 [2002].)
Motion to Dismiss as Facially Insufficient
Defendant’s motion seeking to dismiss the third count of the accusatory instrument, possession of ammunition, pursuant to CPL 170.30, 170.35 and 100.40 is denied. “The factual part of a misdemeanor complaint must allege ‘facts of an evidentiary character’ (CPL 100.15 [3]) demonstrating ‘reasonable cause’ to believe the defendant committed the crime charged (QPL 100.40 [4] [b])” (People v Dumas, 68 NY2d 729, 731 [1986]). cjPL 100.40 states in relevant part,
“[a]n information, or a count thereof, is sufficient on its face when: ,
“(a) It substantially conforms to the requirem|ents prescribed in section 100.15; and
“(b) The allegations of the factual part of the information, together with those of any supporting depositions which may accompany it, provide reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense charged in the accusatory part of the information; and ,
“(c) Non-hearsay allegations of the factual part of the information and/or of any supporting depositions establish, if true, every element of the offense charged and the defendant’s commission thereof.” (See also, People v Alejandro, 70 NY2d 133 [1987].)
Count three of the complaint charges defendant with violating Administrative Code of the City of New York § 10-306 (d), possession of ammunition. Said section states in relevant part, “It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to have a permit in order to possess a rifle or a shotgun and who has not been issued such permit to possess rifle or shotgun ammunition . . . .” The misdemeanor complaint is sworn to by the police officer, deponent, who states “that the defendant did possess two quantities of ammunition for said shotgun, in that the defendant did possess seven 12 gauge shot shells.”
The defense argues that since there is no ballistics report that indicates that the alleged ammunition was found to be operable, this count is insufficient on its face, and has never been converted to an information. However, the ballistics report of the shotgun shows it was operable and shows evidence of discharge. This shotgun was allegedly loaded with two shotgun shells at the time of defendant’s arrest. The People argue that there is no requirement that the People allege that the ammunition is live or operable.
In the complaint the deponent police officer stated “that the defendant did possess two quantities of ammunition for said shotgun, in that the defendant did possess seven 12 gauge shot shells.” Although these statements are allegations of an evidentiary character sufficient to support the requirements of a complaint (see CPL 100.15; People v Dumas, 68 NY2d 729 [1986]), ammunition as proscribed by the Administrative Code is defined in relevant part as “[e]xplosives suitable to be fired” (Administrative Code § 10-301 [7]). To rise to the level of an information each and every element of the offense charged must be supported by nonhearsay. (See, CPL 100.40; People v Alejandro, 70 NY2d 133 [1987].) An essential element of the crime charged is that the ammunition is “suitable to be fired.” In order to determine that said ammunition is “suitable to be fired” the People must have the ammunition tested, attach a ballistics report or attach an eyewitness statement that he observed the ammunition being fired. In order for the prosecution to be ready for trial in cases where defendant is charged with possession of a loaded firearm the prosecution must test the ammunition to see if it was live or operable (People v Daniels, 77 AD2d 745 [1980]; People v Almodovar, NYLJ, Feb. 26, 1999, át 25, col 5 [Grim Ct, Kings County, Torres, J.]).
This court extends this logic to a defendant charged with possession of ammunition in violation of Administrativej Code § 10-306 (d) and holds that in order for the complaint to be converted into an information the prosecution must demonstrate that the ammunition is suitable to be fired. The People also have within the speedy trial limits under CPL 30.30 to convert t!his portion of the complaint into an information (People v Gore, 143 Misc 2d 106 [1989]).",0
0839-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Seymour Rotker, J.
By motion dated August 21, 2003, the defendant seeks an order of the court dismissing the indictment against him pursuant to CPL 210.35 (5) on the ground of defects in the grand jury proceeding or, in the alternative, dismissing counti five, six, seven and eight thereof pursuant to CPL 210.25 (1) on the grounds that these counts are facially defective.
The People have filed an affirmation dated September 24, 2003 opposing the motion on procedural grounds and on the merits. Procedurally, the People claim that there is no “good cause shown” to extend the 45-day period normally allowed for motions of this type pursuant to CPL 255.20. On the rherits, the People contend that the presentation was legally sufécient and proper.
The defendant’s motion to dismiss based on allegedly defective grand jury procedure is, in essence, a motion to renew his prior motion to dismiss which was denied by the court in its decision and order dated April 30, 2003. The basis of the current motion is information regarding the grand jury testimony that was not available to the defendant at the time of the original motion.
Unlike a motion to reargue, a motion for leave to renew is not subject to a specific time limitation. The People are porrect in their allegations regarding the tardiness of the motionj It is also true that the defendant’s papers do not conform to all of the technical requirements of CPLR 2221. Nevertheless, because of the need to protect the integrity of the grand jury proceedings, because the court already decided these issues with respect to the codefendants and because consideration of the motion will not delay the resolution of the matter or prejudice the parties, the court declines to decide the issues on procedural grounds and, under the authority of CPL 255.20 (3), will reach the merits of the defendant’s claim.
Defendant Palmer contends that in presenting the matter to the grand jury the Assistant District Attorney improperly solicited hearsay testimony from Police Officer Lawrence Sullivan and that she also permitted the officer to testify as an expert in the field of ballistics without proper qualifications. The defendant contends that these errors were of such a nature as to impair the integrity of the grand jury proceeding and created a possibility of prejudice to him to the extent that the indictment should be dismissed.
The defendant correctly notes that the Assistant District Attorney is required to act as the legal advisor to the grand jury (CPL 190.25 [6]). As such, the prosecutor has a duty “not only to secure indictments but also to see that justice is done” (People v Lancaster, 69 NY2d 20, 26 [1986]). Consequently it follows that the prosecutor has a duty to insure that the grand jury proceedings conform to the requirements of CPL article 190 which includes a requirement that, with certain exceptions, the “governing rules of evidence and related matters with respect to criminal proceeding in general, are, where appropriate, applicable to grand jury proceedings” (CPL 190.30 [1]). The prosecutor must insure that a potential indictment is neither based on nor infected by hearsay or other improper and inadmissible evidence.
As pointed out by the Court of Appeals in People v Huston (88 NY2d 400, 409 [1996]), however, “not every improper comment, elicitation of inadmissible testimony, impermissible question or mere mistake renders an indictment defective.” According to Huston (at 409), “[dismissal of indictments under CPL 210.35 (5) should be limited to those instances where prosecutorial wrongdoing, fraudulent conduct or errors potentially prejudice the ultimate decision reached by the grand jury.”
Assuming the testimony referred to in the defendant’s affirmation was improper the question becomes whether it was of such a nature as to impair the integrity of the grand jury action to the possible prejudice of the defendant.
Once again, as pointed out in Huston (supra at 41Q), a defendant seeking dismissal of an indictment pursuant to CjPL 210.35 (5) must establish “irregularities in presenting the dase to the Grand Jury [which] rise to a level of impairing those proceedings and creating the risk of prejudice.” In this case the indictment cannot be permitted to stand even though it is ¡supported by legally sufficient evidence (People v Calbud, Inc. 49 NY2d 389, 395 [1980]). In determining the likelihood of prejudice Huston instructs the court to consider the “facts of each case, including the weight and nature of admissible proof adduced to support the indictment and the degree of inappropriate prosecutorial influence or bias” (Huston, supra at 409).
In Huston and in other cases where dismissal has been granted (see, People v Pelchat, 62 NY2d 97 [1984]; see also, People v Winant, 179 Misc 2d 357 [Rensselaer County Ct 1998]), the defendants were able to establish a deliberate patterh of prosecutorial misconduct which served to taint the proceedings even though the evidence supporting the indictments (although marginal) was technically sufficient.
The grand jury presentation in this case was not Completely free from error. The admissible evidence, however, ivas more than sufficient to support the charges and, more to the point, the defendant completely has failed to establish “prosecutorial wrongdoing, fraudulent conduct” or errors sufficiently ¡egregious to “potentially prejudice the ultimate decision reached by the grand jury.”
Accordingly the motion to reargue is granted but the motion to dismiss is again denied.
The defendant’s motion to dismiss based on alleged facial defects in counts five through eight of the indictment has been addressed previously by the court but has apparently not been resolved.
Counts five through eight of the indictmenlj charge, respectively, in concert possession of a loaded fireárm with intent to use unlawfully against another, in concert possession of a loaded firearm with intent to use unlawfully against another, in concert possession of a loaded firearm not in the home or place of business, and in concert possession of ¡a loaded firearm not in the home or place of business. Obviously, counts five and six are identical as are counts seven and eight.
GPL 210.25 (1) provides that an indictment is subject to dismissal if it fails to “substantially conform to the requirements . . . in article two hundred.” i
Among other things article 200 prohibits duplicitous counts (CPL 200.30) and provides that each count must contain “[a] plain and concise factual statement . . . supporting every element of the offense charged . . . with sufficient precision to clearly appraise the defendant ... of the conduct which is the subject of the accusation” (CPL 200.50 [7] [a]).
In People v Iannone (45 NY2d 589 [1978]), the Court of Appeals held that an indictment was not defective on its face even if the People elected to file a bare bones indictment that did little more than set forth the necessary elements of the crime. The Court also held, however, that, upon a proper request by a defendant for a bill of particulars or for discovery, the People must allege specific facts to meet the requirements of CPL 200.50 (7). This is necessary for two reasons. First, due process requires that the defendant is entitled to know what he is accused of so that he can prepare a defense. Second, the accusation must be specific enough so that if he is acquitted or convicted he can assert the judgment as a bar to a second prosecution for the same offense.
The questioned counts in this indictment set forth no specific facts. All of the defendants, including Mr. Palmer, have requested bills of particulars. The initial bill of particulars filed by the People in Palmer’s case alleged, in relevant part, that “the defendant, acting in concert [with the other three defendants] acted as lookouts, then burst through the door of [the victims’ apartment] while brandishing handguns and fired at and in the complainants’ direction” (dated Apr. 15, 2003). In response to a prior decision of the court (dated Apr. 30, 2003), the People filed a supplemental bill (dated May 14, 2003). This time it was alleged that defendant Palmer “acted as a lookout near the downstairs door, while defendants Campbell and Williams, burst into the complainants’ room, each brandishing a handgun which they fired at and in the direction of the complainants.” The supplemental bill also alleged that all four defendants “fled the scene in a vehicle being driven by Dave Palmer, and were apprehended within a few minutes nearby, in possession of a [handgun], beneath the driver’s seat of the vehicle.”
There is no doubt that the evidence before the grand jury supports three separate charges or groups of charges with respect to possession of firearms. These are (1) in concert possession of the firearm in defendant Campbell’s hand in the complainant’s apartment, (2) in concert possession of the firearm in defendant Williams’ hand in the apartment, and (3) possession by each defendant individually of the weapon found under the seat in the vehicle. j
The problem which must be resolved (this can be easily done) is that three firearms are involved but the indictment only contains two groupings of related counts. Unless th^is issue is addressed the counts are defective because they are unacceptably vague and are potentially duplicitous.
Pursuant to CPL 200.30 (1) “[e]ach count of an indictment may charge one offense only.” If, as appears from théir bills of particulars, the People intend to charge three separate weapons offenses there must be three separate counts or groups of counts. If possession of three weapons is charged in two counts one of the counts must be, by definition, duplicitous.
Pursuant to CPL 200.50 (7) (a) an indictment must contain “[a] plain and concise factual statement in each count which, without allegations of an evidentiary nature . . . asserts facts supporting every element of the offense charged.” This statute, as noted previously, has been construed by the Ianpone case. According to Professor Preiser’s Commentary, Iannone holds that under modern rules of procedure an indictment may “well be technically adequate to fulfill the requirements of this section [CPL 200.50 (7)], but nevertheless lack sufficient substance to be of any practical value to the defendant in regard to one or more of the factors. The reason for this seeming paradox is that under modern criminal procedure the defendant majr demand and receive substantial additional pre-trial information through a bill of particulars (CPL § 200.95) and through discovery (CPL Article 240)” (Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinriey’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 200.50, at 469-470).
When the People exercise their right to file an ihdictment which “itself provides a paucity of information . . . the court must be vigilant in safeguarding the defendant’s rights to a bill of particulars and to effective discovery. Should the prosecutor decide to use an indictment which, although technically sufficient, does not adequately allow a defendant to properly prepare for trial, he may well run afoul of the defendant’s right to be informed of the accusations against him” (People v Iannone, supra at 599).
The principles involved here are illustrated in People v Rosado (64 AD2d 172 [1st Dept 1978]). In that case three individuals robbed the victim. During the robbery, one individual (Rosado) displayed a handgun. Two of the three alleged robbers were apprehended a short time following the incident. At the time of the arrest both were armed. The indictment contained two identical counts (numbered two and four) of possession of a firearm with intent to use it unlawfully against another. At a pretrial hearing the defendants both moved to strike the weapons counts for “lack of specificity.” The Court (at 175) denied the motion and eventually charged the jury that count two “related to the pistol used in the ‘actual holdup of the [victim]’ ” which Rosado had in his possession “when . . . apprehended and searched.” The Court charged that both defendants could be found guilty of this count on an acting in concert theory. The Court dismissed count four as to Rosado. It charged that count (count four) as to Rodriguez only and stated that it referred to his possession at the time of the arrest.
The defendants were acquitted of robbery. Each defendant was convicted of a weapons possession count. The Appellate Division reversed as to both defendants with leave to resubmit the charges to a new grand jury. The Court held (at 176) that “as originally drawn, the weapons counts of the indictment were defective by their failure to assert facts which supported ‘every element of the offense charged . . . with sufficient precision to clearly appraise the . . . defendants of the conduct which is the subject of the accusation’ . . . Neither count specified whether the possession of the weapon referred to the conduct of the defendants at the time of the robbery or of the arrest.”
The Court ruled that, under count two as submitted, the jury could have found Rosado guilty of possession on either of two occasions. Thus, the count was duplicitous. Although the lower court’s charge as to count four addressed the defect by making it clear that Rodriguez could be found guilty only of possession at the time of the arrest, reversal was required because the trial of the case under a duplicitous count prejudiced the defendant. (See also People v Davis, 72 NY2d 32 [1988]; People v Jackson, 174 AD2d 444 [1st Dept 1991]; People v Jones, 251 AD2d 350 [2d Dept 1998].)
Based upon the foregoing, the court will be compelled to dismiss counts five through eight of this indictment as defective unless, within two weeks of the service of this decision, the People specify either in a bill of particulars or in a stipulation on the record possession of which of the three potential firearms (the firearm found in the vehicle or those allegedly used by Williams and/or Campbell) supported by the grand jury evidence is alleged in each of the four counts. Contrary to the conclusion in the People’s affirmation in opposition!, they are not being required to “specify which of the shooters had which weapon.” What the People are being required to do is to specify with respect to each weapons possessions count one firearm and one location at which it was possessed. !
. The defendant received copies of the relevant grand jury minutes on or about May 1 but did not file this motion until August 21, 2003. CPLR 2221 also provides that a motion to renew shall be identified as such. The fact that the defendant was not in possession of the grand jury minutes when he filed his original motion constitutes the required “reasonable justification” for failure to fully articulate these claims in the prior motion.
. The People are also correct in alleging that the grand jury evidence supports, on an acting in concert theory, liability of all four defendants for possession of each of the two firearms allegedly displayed and fired in the apartment. The same evidence also supports separate individual charges against each of the defendants for possession of the one weapon found iii the vehicle which may or may not have been one of the weapons displayed during the shootout in the apartment. Any charge based on this firearm cannot be based on an in concert theory and is a felony only with respect to Palmer because only he possessed ammunition for the weapon. In any event, each of the four challenged counts can allege only one possession offense and the People are required, subject to the grand jury evidence, to disclose to the defendant prior to trial which specific offense is intended to be charged in each of|the individual counts.",1
0552-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Larry M. Himelein, J.
Transportation Law § 18 gives the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) a preferential right to acquire abandoned railroad property. Subdivision (1) of this section prohibits a property owner from “disposing” of abandoned railroad property unless the Commissioner notifies the owner that the preferential right does not apply to the property or the Commissioner releases the preferential right. Any conveyance that violates “this section shall be null and void” (Transportation Law § 18 [1] [emphasis supplied]).
On October 29, 1994, plaintiff Peter Krog and third-party defendant Buffalo Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc. (BPR) entered into a lease agreement whereby Krog paid BPR a onetime payment of $42,000 to lease a parcel of abandoned railroad property for 40 years with an option to purchase the property at any time during the lease term for $1. At that point, the railroad had not sought the release required by the Transportation Law. On January 9, 1995, more than two months later, the railroad requested a release of the preferential right from DOT. In its letter to DOT, the railroad did not mention the fact that it had already leased the property to Krog.
On January 20, 1995, DOT notified the Mayor of the Village of Ellicottville that a request for the release of the department’s preferential right had been made. On January 24, 1995, DOT notified the railroad that the preferential right applied to the property. On February 24, 1995, the Mayor of Ellicottville wrote DOT requesting that the Village be allowed to exercise the preferential right to acquire the property. DOT approved the request and on July 19, 1995, DOT notified BPR that it had assigned its preferential right to the Village.
Plaintiff commenced this action in 2000 seeking to eject the Village from the property. The Village answered and also brought a third-party action against the railroad claiming, inter alia, that the lease between plaintiff and BPR was void as violative of Transportation Law § 18; that the Village had acquired title to the property by adverse possession; or, alternatively, that the Village had acquired a prescriptive easement over the property. The railroad in turn cross-claimed against Krog.
After other pleadings were filed and depositions conducted, plaintiff moved for summary judgment claiming (1) DOT’s preferential right of acquisition under the Transportation Law had expired; (2) even if the right had not expired, the Village failed to exercise the right and it therefore reverted to DOT; (3) the Village had not established adverse possession; and (4) the Village had not established an easement by prescription. The Village cross-moved for summary judgment (1) voiding the lease for noncompliance with the Transportation Law; (2) granting title to the Village on the basis of adverse possession; or, alternatively, (3) granting the Village an easement by prescription over the property.
The lease at issue was executed on October 29, 1994. At that time, the railroad had not sought the release required by the Transportation Law. Therefore, it appears that the conveyance “shall be null and void” (Transportation Law § 18 [1]). Krog and BPR, however, contend that DOT’s preferential right expired before it was later assigned to the Village and, even if the right did not expire, the Village defaulted by failing to timely exercise the right: Those contentions gloss over the fact that the initial transfer to Krog was void. Apparently, the argument is that either the expiration of the preferential right or the Village’s default in not timely exercising the right somehow restores to validity a transfer the law deems void.
Alternatively, plaintiff and BPR claim that the lease was not a “transfer” of the property. They argue that the lease agreement does not “dispose” of the property under the Transportation Law because the transfer was a 40-year lease with an option to buy for $1 at any time. They suggest that only an outright sale “disposes” of the property. The court declines to split that hair.
Initially, the statute itself does not create such a limitation. Even if it did, the agreement between Krog and BPR is effectively a sale because Krog can purchase the property for $1 any time during the 40-year lease term. The interpretation suggested by Krog and BPR would allow the Transportation Law to be circumvented by simply inserting a $1 purchase option into any property agreement involving abandoned railroad property (see e.g. Matter of Consolidated Rail Corp. v State of New York, 259 AD2d 814 [1999]). This would defeat the legislative purpose of making abandoned railroad property available for public use whenever feasible (see L 1973, ch 998, § 1).
Krog and BPR next contend that DOT’s preferential right expired “as a matter of law” because DOT did not notify Krog that it had assigned its preferential right to acquire the property until July 19, 1995, which is 191 days after the railroad’s January 9, 1995 letter to DOT. Because Transportation Law § 18 (1-c) requires DOT to notify the property owner within 120 days whether DOT intends to exercise its right or assign it to another agency, Krog and BPR claim that DOT’s preferential right expired. No authority is cited for this proposition and, given the requirements of the Transportation Law, the court does not believe the statute was intended to cut off DOT’s rights on the 121st day.
Transportation Law § 18 (1-c) requires DOT, once the property owner asks for the release of the preferential right, to inform state agencies, every metropolitan or regional transportation authority, and every county, city, town or village in which the railroad property or part of it is located, of the owner’s request for release of the preferential right. Any governmental agency which intends to exercise its own preferential right must then notify DOT. The statute then requires DOT to notify the property owner of its intent within 120 days of the owner’s notification to DOT. However, with all these mandatory notification requirements, the court does not believe the Legislature intended to cut off DOT’s rights immediately after 120 days expired.
Moreover, the court suspects the statute intended the 120 days to apply to governmental agencies rather than the owner of the property. The relevant part of section 18 (1-c) reads as follows:
“Within a reasonable time thereafter, any agency of government which intends to exercise a preferential acquisition right for such property shall notify the department of transportation in writing. Within a reasonable time, not greater than one hundred twenty days after receipt of such notification by the property owner, the department of transportation shall notify the property owner in writing whether the department of transportation intends to exercise its preferential acquisition right under this section or, if not, whether it has determined that any other agency of government has been authorized by it to exercise a preferential right to such property” (emphasis supplied).
If the phrase “such notification by the property owner” was replaced by “such notification by the agency of government,” the statute makes far more sense. The sentence immediately before the quoted section refers to government agencies, not the owner of the property, and the court believes a drafting error occurred. It is more logical that the governmental agency seeking the preferential right notifies DOT and after that notification, DOT has 120 days to notify the property owner whether DOT will exercise the preferential right or permit the other governmental agency to do so. Nonetheless, the court will construe the statute as written; if the Legislature meant something else, the Legislature or a higher court may say so.
Plaintiff and the railroad also contend that even if the court finds the 120-day period inapplicable, the Village’s Transportation Law counterclaim must still be stricken. They claim that the statute gives DOT 180 days to release its preferential right. Because it took DOT 191 days to assign the preferential right, plaintiff and the railroad argue that the right expired.
However, by its plain terms, the 180-day period applies only when DOT intends to release the preferential right. In that case, if DOT fails to give notice that it intends to release the preferential right, the right is deemed to have expired. In this case, DOT did not release the preferential right; it assigned the right to the Village of Ellicottville. The attempt to rewrite the statute is unavailing and Matter of Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v Lake Placid Branch Track (366 F Supp 62 [1973]), cited by plaintiff, provides no support for his contention. That case involved a railroad in bankruptcy and concerned ownership of the rails themselves, not the realty upon which the rails were situated.
Krog and BPR further contend that even if the preferential right did not expire and the assignment to the Village was valid, the Village defaulted by failing to timely exercise the preferential right. This court does not believe that contention withstands scrutiny. On August 28, 1995, less than four weeks after the assignment to the Village, counsel for the Village contacted BPR’s attorney to discuss the Village’s rights. At that time, counsel for BPR told the Village’s attorney that BPR had already entered into a lease agreement with plaintiff. BPR’s counsel followed up with a letter on August 30, 1995. The Village’s attorney also spoke with plaintiffs attorney on September 15, 1995.
While plaintiff and BPR allege that the delay between 1995 and the commencement of suit results in a default on the part of the Village, they again cite no authority to support that contention and they themselves did nothing to shorten the delay. Immediately after receiving the assignment of the preferential right, the Village attempted to pursue its rights and learned for the first time that plaintiff and BPR had entered into an illegal — and void — lease agreement. Plaintiff and the railroad point to no steps the Village could have taken and, short of a lawsuit, there are few that come to mind. Moreover, it was plaintiff’s and BPR’s violation of the Transportation Law that caused the problems at issue here. Further, even if the Village had defaulted, the preferential right would presumably revert back to DOT; that still does not help plaintiff or BPR with respect to their void transaction.
Because the Transportation Law makes the transfer from BPR to Krog “null and void,” and because the court is not persuaded that any of the contentions of Krog and BPR on this issue have merit, plaintiffs summary judgment motion must be denied. Further, the Village is entitled to summary judgment on its second counterclaim declaring the lease between plaintiff and BPR to be void.
Turning now to the Village’s claims of adverse possession and easement by prescription, a party making a claim of title by adverse possession must establish five elements by clear and convincing evidence: (1) possession that is hostile and under a claim of right; (2) actual possession; (3) open and notorious possession; (4) exclusive possession; and (5) continuous possession (MAG Assoc. v SDR Realty, 247 AD2d 516 [1998]; Belotti v Bickhardt, 228 NY 296 [1920]).
On February 24, 1995, the Village informed DOT that it wanted to be authorized to exercise DOT’s preferential right. Clearly, that letter is inconsistent with a claim of right to the same property (see Van Gorder v Masterplanned, Inc., 78 NY2d 1106 [1991]; Solow v Liebman, 253 AD2d 808 [1998]). That by itself requires denial of the motion seeking summary judgment on the Village’s first counterclaim claiming title by adverse possession.
The court notes further that there are multiple additional factual reasons to deny the Village’s cross motion for summary judgment on adverse possession grounds. For example, it was disputed whether the Village exclusively occupied the property; the Village Board voted to authorize their attorney to attempt to buy the property, indicating that the Village knew it did not own the property; numerous Village officials believed that BPR owned the property; and other organizations used the property during the time frame at issue. Any one of these factors also mandates denial of the Village’s motion for summary judgment on the adverse possession cause of action.
Many of the reasons which require denial of the Village’s motion on adverse possession grounds also require denial of its motion for summary judgment on the easement by prescription claim. To establish a prescriptive easement, a party must establish use of the property that is “adverse, open and notorious, continuous and uninterrupted” for a 10-year period (Pierce v Frost, 295 AD2d 894, 894 [2002], quoting Di Leo v Pecksto Holding Corp., 304 NY 505, 512 [1952]; see also Lyon v Melino, 214 AD2d 992 [1995]). At best, there are questions of fact that mandate denial of the Village’s motion for summary judgment on its third counterclaim.",0

Orín R. Kitzes, J.
Motion by plaintiff for an order, pursuant to CPLR 3215, granting a default judgment in its favor and declaring that defendant United is required to specifically perform the contract for the sale of certain premises is denied, for the following reasons:
The complaint was served on defendant on or about February 13, 2003 and to date defendant United has failed to answer, move or otherwise appear. The complaint alleges that defendant United is a domestic not-for-profit corporation, organized pursuant to the laws of New York State. On or about February 13, 2000, plaintiff entered into a contract with United to purchase the premises located at 126-18 Liberty Avenue, Richmond Hill, New York. Plaintiff has attempted to close on that contract; however, United has refused to accept the tender of the purchase price. Plaintiff now moves for a default judgment. Defendant New York State Attorney General opposes this motion, arguing that this court cannot award specific performance of the contract in the absence of a showing that the statutory requirements of Not-For-Profit Corporation Law §§ 510 and 511 have been met. Plaintiff acknowledges that this statute applies to United; however, plaintiff argues that, in essence, as a purchaser of property from a not-for-profit corporation that has breached a contract, it must be afforded rights to enforce its contract.
N-PCL 510 (a) requires that the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of substantially all the assets of a not-for-profit corporation shall require leave of the Supreme Court in the judicial district or of the County Court of the county in which the corporation has its office or principal place of carrying out the purposes for which it was formed. N-PCL 511 (d) requires that a corporation required by law to obtain leave of court to sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets, shall present a verified petition to the Supreme Court of the judicial district, which shall set forth, inter alia, that the consideration and the terms of the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of the assets of the corporation are fair and reasonable to the corporation, and that the purposes of the corporation, or the interests of its members will be promoted thereby, and a concise statement of the reasons therefor. The purpose of these sections is to preserve charitable assets for the benefit of the public by “protect[ing] charitable organizations from loss through unwise bargains.” (64th Assoc. v Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hosp., 301 AD2d 462, 462 [1st Dept 2003].) While the court is aware of the need to protect plaintiffs interest, there is no authority to award plaintiff specific performance without United having met the requirements of N-POL 510 and 511. Accordingly, the plaintiffs motion is denied, in its entirety.",0

Mary H. Smith, J.
By Indictment No. 03-0845, defendant Edward Hammonds has been accused of one count of robbery in the first degree (Penal Law § 160.15 [3]), one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Penal Law § 265.02 [1]), one count of grand larceny in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 155.30 [5]), and one count of menacing in the second degree (Penal Law § 120.14 [1]). The acts allegedly occurred on or about September 5, 2002. The People have moved, by way of an order to show cause, for an order from this court requiring defendant to appear in a lineup pursuant to CPL 240.40 (2) (b) (i). Defendant opposes the People’s motion on the grounds that it is untimely and not supported by good cause. Alternatively, defendant requests that should the lineup be granted, the court impose that the lineup be held in a double-blind and sequential manner to reduce the opportunity for misidentification. In addition, defendant requests that the People be required to provide a stenographer and photographer to record the lineup proceedings. Upon consideration of these papers, the motion for a lineup is disposed of as follows:
Background
The People filed the instant application three days after the court issued its decision and order on defendant’s omnibus motion and at a time when the case should have been ready for trial. The People’s late submission of this application does not go unnoticed and raises some question concerning the strength of the People’s case given the rather lackluster approach law enforcement has taken with regard to their prosecution of defendant to date. Indeed, defendant was not even arrested on the charges underlying this indictment until nine months after the date of the alleged crimes, when he was arrested on an unrelated misdemeanor offense. This late arrest occurred even though the alleged victim identified defendant from a mug shot book eight days after the crimes’ commission. In addition, law enforcement should have been aware of defendant’s whereabouts because he was on probation (and gainfully employed) and, according to defendant, still residing at the Peekskill address that was reflected on his criminal records. The court has ordered a Wade hearing on the noticed identification procedure and notes that to the extent that the identification is suppressed as being unduly suggestive (and there is no independent basis for an in-court identification), any identification that may result from the lineup that is being ordered herein would necessarily be tainted by the first identification procedure and should likewise be suppressed.
Standard of Review for CPL 240.40 (2) (b) (i) Application
Pursuant to CPL 240.40 (2) (b) (i), the People may request a court order (postindictment) requiring defendant’s participation in a corporeal lineup. That statute provides: “[u]pon motion of the prosecutor, and subject to constitutional limitation, the court in which an indictment... is pending . . . may order the defendant to provide non-testimonial evidence. Such order may, among other things, require the defendant to . . . [alppear in a line-up.” The court order may also include a protective order which has the effect of “denying, limiting, conditioning, delaying or regulating discovery pursuant to this article for good cause, including constitutional limitations.” (CPL 240.50; see CPL 240.40 [3].)
Because the lineup results in the seizure of defendant’s body, the constitutional requirements of the Fourth Amendment must be satisfied before a court may order defendant’s participation. Thus, “[i]t is well established that a suspect may be ordered to appear in a lineup, or provide other nontestimonial evidence, when ‘the People establish (1) probable cause to believe the suspect has committed the crime, (2) a “clear indication” that relevant material evidence will be found, and (3) the method used to secure it is safe and reliable.’ ” (People v Shields, 155 AD2d 978 [1989], lv denied 75 NY2d 818 [1990], quoting Matter of Abe A., 56 NY2d 288, 291 [1982], and citing People v London, 124 AD2d 254, 256 [1986], lv denied 68 NY2d 1001 [1986]; Matter of Pidgeon v Rubin, 80 AD2d 568 [1981]; see also People v Cassese, 1995 WL 251647 [Nassau County Ct, Mar. 23, 1995, Kowtna, J.].) Thus, “the granting of relief pursuant to CPL 240.40 (subd 2, par [b], cl [i]) is permissive or discretionary . . . [and] the prosecutor is under a burden to demonstrate ‘probable cause’ for the ‘necessity’ of the proposed procedure ... a requirement which is in addition to the demonstration of ‘probable cause’ that a crime has been committed and the defendant has committed it.” (People v Boudin, 114 Misc 2d 523, 525 [1982]; see also People v Handley, 105 Misc 2d 215 [1980].)
Here, the probable cause that a crime has been committed and that defendant committed it has been satisfied by the grand jury’s return of a true bill against defendant. The court has already determined in its decision and order dated October 14, 2003 that the grand jury proceedings were not defective and that there was sufficient evidence presented to uphold the indictment. And while not argued in the People’s application, there is good cause for the ordering of a lineup because “[b]ased upon the admissibility of evidence of a previous corporeal identification procedure as evidence in chief at trial (CPL 60.25, 60.30) versus the inadmissibility of evidence of a prior photographic identification procedure, it is apparent that the People have established probable cause for the 'necessity’ or reasonableness of the requested lineup procedure.” (People v Boudin, 114 Misc 2d at 527.)
Pros/Cons of the Double-Blind/Sequential Lineup
From the facts of the case known to date, it is the court’s understanding that the reliability of the victim’s identification of defendant may well determine the outcome of this case. At the determination of trial readiness conference held on October 14, 2003, defendant insisted on addressing the court and, in the course of his protestations of innocence, defendant raised a couple of salient points — i.e., law enforcement’s failure to arrest him for nine months following the crimes and the serious discrepancies between the victim’s description of the perpetrator to the police versus the defendant’s physical characteristics. According to the People, defendant was identified by the victim from a mug shot book, but again there has been no determination regarding whether that identification procedure was unduly suggestive and, if so, whether there exists an independent basis for an in-court identification. That decision is left to the sound discretion of the Wade hearing court.
Because the reliability of the victim’s identification may well be the pivotal issue in this case (the District Attorney having identified little other evidence linking defendant to the crime), defendant has requested that if the court grants the People’s lineup application, the court should also require that certain methodologies be used in the lineup. Thus, defendant asserts that the current procedure employed — a simultaneous lineup where the law enforcement personnel charged with conducting the lineup have knowledge of the true suspect’s identity — is flawed and cannot produce reliable identifications. Rather, it is defendant’s contention that the court should order a method that has been winning favor in the scientific community known as the double-blind, sequential lineup. In the currently used simultaneous lineup, defendant is viewed along with ajd the other potential suspects (known as fillers) at once; one of the arguments against the use of this lineup procedure is that the witness may not perform the appropriate analysis in making an identification. Thus, rather than comparing each suspect to the memory the witness has of the perpetrator, the witness instead compares the potential suspects against each other and picks the one that most closely matches his memory of the perpetrator. By comparison, the sequential method requires that the witness view each potential suspect separately and tljen make a determination on each individually without ever viewing all the suspects simultaneously. In some controlled studies, this method has been shown to reduce misidentifications by as much as 50%. (See Feige and Bailey, Point/Counterpoint: Police Lineups, Do Sequential Lineups Improve Accuracy of Witness Identifications?, NYLJ Mag, Dec. 2002, at 10, col 1.) Critics of these studies rightly argue that a controlled study involving mock crimes cannot possibly simulate the trauma involved in an actual crime and the impacts that such trauma may have on the memory of the crime victim. (See id.) And there are other arguments against the movement to sequential lineups, including one which suggests that the method may reduce the number of correct identifications. (See id.; see also People v Kixby, NYLJ, Oct. 21, 2002, at 25, col 4, citing Steblay et al., Eyewitness Accuracy Rates in Sequential and Simultaneous Lineup Presenta tions: A Meta-Analytic Comparison, 25 Law & Hum Behav 459 [20Ó1]; Judges, Two Cheers for the Department of Justice’s Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement, 53 Ark L Rev 231 [2000]; Lindsay and Wells, Improving Eyewitness Identifications from Lineups: Simultaneous Versus Sequential Lineup Presentations, 70 J Applied Psychol 556 [1985].)
Nevertheless, while there is disagreement over the validity of the results of the sequential lineup studies, there appears to be no disagreement over the benefit of having a double-blind lineup. Thus “[njumerous scientific studies suggest that officers who know the identity of a true suspect in a lineup might influence the decision of a witness, even unintentionally, through suggestive words or movements.” (Perrotta, Hynes Endorses Double-Blind Police Lineups, NYLJ, Dec. 13, 2002, at 1, col 3.) As noted by one court when describing a submission made by the District Attorney’s expert: “while there may not be ‘100 percent agreement among all experts’ on the desirability of sequential lineups under all circumstances ‘[t]he same is not true of double-blind testing,’ which he describes as ‘something for which there is no disagreement among experts at all.’ ” (People v Wilson, 191 Misc 2d 224, 228 [2002].) In addition, unlike the impact associated with the implementation of the sequential lineup, the use of a double-blind lineup would not appear to pose a significant drain on law enforcement manpower. (See id.)
Whether to Order a Double-Blind Sequential Lineup
The court’s authority to order that the District Attorney employ the sequential and/or double-blind lineup, however, is unsettled. There is currently a split at the trial court level (with apparently no appellate court decisions to date) over a court’s power to order double-blind and/or sequential lineups. Some courts hold the doctrine of separation of powers between the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government requires judicial deference. Therefore, these courts hold that it would be an improper infringement on law enforcement (and without a legal basis) for courts to order such lineups, especially since the simultaneous lineup procedure has been upheld by the New York Court of Appeals in People v Chipp (75 NY2d 327 [1990], cert denied 498 US 833 [1990]) as constitutional. (See People v M.A., 194 Misc 2d 449 [2002]; People v Alcime, 2002 NY Slip Op 40021[U] [2002]; People v Martinez, 2001 NY Slip Op 50130[U] [2001]; People v Franco, NYLJ, July 5, 2001, at 20, col 5; People v Cassese, 1995 WL 251647 [1995]; People v Aspinall, 194 Misc 2d 630 [2003].) Most courts nevertheless see the potential value in these alternative lineups and encourage their local district attorneys’ offices to follow other jurisdictions that have implemented either one (i.e., Brooklyn’s adoption of the double-blind simultaneous lineup) or both (i.e., New Jersey’s and Santa Clara, California’s adoption of the double-blind, sequential lineup). (See Perrotta, Hynes Endorses Double-Blind Police Lineups, NYLJ, Dec. 13, 2002, at 1, col 3.) Still other courts decline to order the double-blind, sequential lineups because of the conflicting scientific proof and lack of real world simulation inherent in these studies. (See Matter of Taylor, NYLJ, Oct. 4, 2002, at 21, col 4.)
By contrast, a number of courts order double-blind and/or sequential lineups finding that “[t]he doctrine of separation of powers does not require courts to turn a blind eye to the social science research and wait passively for the legislature or the police to decide to adopt new procedures that enhance the fairness of judicial proceedings, but may rule upon the propriety of and necessity for such procedures as the issues are raised.” (People v Kirby, NYLJ, Oct. 21, 2002, at 25, col 4, citing People v Wilson, 191 Misc 2d 224 [2002]; Matter of Thomas, 189 Misc 2d 487 [2001].) The legal basis for these orders emanates from different theories. Some courts find authority within their inherent authority to control the content of their orders. (See Matter of Thomas, 189 Misc 2d at 493.) Other courts find authority in the New York Court of Appeals decision in Matter of Abe A. (56 NY2d 288, 298 [1982]), which holds that in determining whether to issue an order requiring that blood be drawn from defendant, the court must consider whether “the method by which the authorized intrusion to be accomplished must be safe, reliable and impose no more physical discomfort than is reasonably necessary.” (See People v Kirby, NYLJ, Oct. 21, 2002, at 25, col 4 [“When the government can conduct an investigative procedure only by court order, it is the court’s responsibility to ensure that the People have established the reliability of the proposed procedure and must, before granting the order, weigh alternative methods for obtaining the evidence”]; Matter of Thomas, 189 Misc 2d 487, 492-493 [2001] [“The court reads this sentence as authorizing consideration of the ‘reliability’ of a requested procedure as well as the ‘reasonable necessity’ of the procedure . . . [and] if there is a better or lesser intrusive means available to accomplish the goal then a court should direct that those other more reliable or better methods be performed”].) The final line of authority is the catch-all notion that “[t]he Supreme Court of the State of New York has general original jurisdiction in law and equity, vesting in this court the inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction.” (Matter of People v Wilson, 191 Misc 2d 224, 225 [2002].)
While the court is not opposed to finding that it has the power to order that the lineup be held in a particular manner, it will not utilize such power for a number of reasons. First, while it would seem self-evident that the sequential method might provide more reliable results, given the amount of controversy surrounding the validity of the studies (both with regard to their inability to replicate the impact on memory recall of a real world crime victim and with regard to the results which suggest that sequential lineups may reduce the number of correct identifications), the court is not willing to usurp law enforcement’s discretion in the procedure they choose so long as the procedure has been held to be constitutional. Second, while there is no such controversy surrounding the double-blind method, if the court were to order that it be employed in this lineup, the court would be embarking on a “slippery slope” and would be hard pressed to deny future applications ¡that were grounded on scientific evidence tending to show that another more reliable lineup procedure de jure should be employed. Thus, the court believes the more prudent course is to leave that decision to the legislative and/or executive branches and hopes that they will “do justice” by adopting the double-blind methodology since there is no disagreement over its! beneficial effects in doing away with any unintentional suggqstiveness which may occur through body language.
Finally, it is unfortunate but given the circumstances of this case, the use of a double-blind sequential lineup would most likely have no impact whatsoever on the reliability of the identification procedure employed in this case. To tjhe extent there has been a misidentification, the damage is irreparable since the alleged victim has already chosen defendant’s photo from a mug shot book and that picture is forever imprinted on his mind. This phenomenon has been described as follows:
“Worse yet, after a misidentification occurs, the witness’s sense of recall can become impaired— perhaps irreparably — as the defendant’s im¡age tends to supplant the image of the actual criminal. The Supreme Court made this point in its first photographic identity case [Simmons v United States, 390 US 377, 383-384 (1968)], when it stated that ‘[r]egardless of how the initial misidentification comes about, the witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the image of the photograph ratiher than of the person actually seen, reducing ithe trustworthiness of subsequent lineup or courtroom identification.” (People v Gee, 99 NY2d 158, 163 [2002].)
Thus, it would appear that the benefits of a double-blind sequential lineup would be lost in a case where the victim has already identified the defendant from a photograph because it is more likely than not that the victim will again identify defendant in the lineup (whether it be sequential or simultaneous) based on his recollection of the defendant’s photograph.
The simultaneous, non-double-blind lineup has not been attacked as constitutionally infirm. In the end, courts must review the identification procedure employed to determine if it was unduly suggestive and, if so, whether there exists an independent basis for an in-court identification.
Nevertheless, given the critical nature of the identification evidence in this case, as well as the apparent weaknesses in the prosecution’s case, the court orders that the People furnish a stenographer and photographer to memorialize the lineup proceedings. (See People v Cassese, 1995 WL 251647 [1995] [videotaping of lineup]; People v Boudin, 114 Misc 2d 523 [1982] [stenographic recording and photographing of lineup]; CPL 240.40 [3]; 240.50.) It is hoped that these additional safeguards (including defense counsel’s presence) will reduce the opportunity for any unintentional suggestiveness from law enforcement personnel. Moreover, in addition to defense counsel’s recollection of the propriety of the procedures employed, there will be an available record in the event another suppression motion regarding the suggestiveness of this lineup procedure is necessary. And again, the court recommends that the District Attorney’s office does justice and uses the double-blind method for this lineup, as well as for all future lineups.
Based on the foregoing, the People’s application is granted to the extent that a lineup is hereby ordered. The court further orders the People to provide defense counsel with notice seven days in advance of the date on which the lineup is scheduled to be held, and furnish the services of a stenographer and photographer to memorialize the lineup proceedings. Defendant’s application for a double-blind, sequential lineup is denied, but the court does agree and joins other courts that have recommended to their district attorneys’ offices that the offices “do justice” by employing the double-blind methodology in their lineups. (See People v M.A., 194 Misc 2d 449.)
. The double-blind aspect simply means that the law enforcement officers conducting the lineup have no knowledge as to which of the participants is a filler or the true suspect. ¡
. The court in Matter of Thomas (189 Misc 2d 487 [2001]) explained the phenomenon as follows: “Psychologists speculate that in a simultaneous lineup the viewer subconsciously believes that he or she should select the person that most resembles the perpetrator . . . Since the viewer believes that the alleged perpetrator is in the lineup, the viewer will in all likelihood select a person from the lineup based upon the person who most closely depicts tjhe perpetrator rather than from a recollection that the person is in fact the!perpetrator. In a sequential lineup, the viewer performs a ‘recall oriented function’ in that the viewer compares the person being viewed by him or her at the lineup with the person that he or she recalls as being involved in the incident, . . .” (Matter of Thomas, 189 Misc 2d at 489-490.)
. However, if law enforcement personnel permit a witness to have a second bite at the apple by allowing a second sequential lineup using the same potential suspects, the sequential lineup becomes indistinguishable from the simultaneous lineup. (See People v M.A., 194 Misc 2d 449, 457 n 9 [2002].)
. There are also issues concerning the studies’ validity because many (if not all) use photographs rather than live people in their stagedl sequential/ simultaneous lineups.
. Clearly, if the simultaneous non-double-blind methodology was determined to be unconstitutional, the court would be empowered to order other procedures found to be constitutional to protect defendant’s due process rights. At least one New York court has found the sequential method to be constitutional. (See People v Blue, 165 Misc 2d 1000 [1995], affd 267 AD2d 317 [1999], lv denied 95 NY2d 832 [2000].)
. These courts draw from the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Illinois v Lafayette (462 US 640 [1983]), which was a case in which the Supreme Court declined to find power in the judiciary under the Fourth Amendment to direct that a particular procedure be used in an inventory search because “the real question is not what ‘could have been achieved,’ but whether the Fourth Amendment requires such steps; it is not our function to write a manual on administering routine, neutral procedures of the station house. Our role is to assure against violations of the Constitution.” (Illinois v Lafayette, 462 US at 647.) Another court denied defendant’s request that a blank lineup be conducted holding that such a request was “not within the ambit of judicial discretion.” (See People v Guerea, 78 Misc 2d 907, 910 [1974].)
. At least one defendant has argued that “the greater accuracy of the double-blind, sequential lineup procedure constitutes a lesser intrusion on his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.” (People v M.A., 194 Misc 2d 449, 451 [2002].) This argument is flawed since the intrusion on defendant in submitting to a simultaneous lineup is indistinguishable from the intrusion incurred as a result of his submitting to a double-blind sequential lineup.

0013-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Memorandum.
Judgment unanimously reversed without costs and a new trial ordered.
In this negligence action for personal injuries, the court dismissed the action after both sides rested. Plaintiff Milagros Depena was a passenger in the back of an ambulette driven by defendant Higgs which stopped short and was hit in the rear by another vehicle. It is well settled that a rear-end collision with a stopped vehicle establishes a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the operator of the moving vehicle and imposes a duty on that operator to explain how the collision occurred (Leal v Wolff, 224 AD2d 392 [1996]; see also Tricoli v Malik, 268 AD2d 469 [2000]), which the operator of the moving vehicle herein failed to do.
However, the injured plaintiff testified that defendant Higgs was driving approximately 40 miles per hour and only 10 feet behind the vehicle in front. She told Higgs that he was driving too fast. She further testified that the vehicle in front braked and Higgs “deviated, that’s when all of us went in front.” The ambulette never came in contact with the vehicle in front but was struck in the rear.
Based on said testimony, it was erroneous to determine credibility as a matter of law. We are of the opinion that there are triable issues of fact which should have been presented to the jury as to whether the driver of the ambulette was driving in an unreasonable manner by driving too fast and too close to the car in front and, if so, whether his unreasonable driving was a proximate cause of plaintiff Milagros Depena’s injuries (see Darmento v Pacific Molasses Co., 81 NY2d 985 [1993]).
We note that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence that portion of the accident report which consisted of self-serving hearsay statements (Casey v Tierno, 127 AD2d 727 [1987]). It was error for the trial court to have allowed the police officer to testify, based on the police report, as to what Higgs said to him because Higgs was under no duty to report the accident to the police officer and Higgs’ statement does not qualify as a declaration against interest or fall under some other exception to the hearsay rule (Cover v Cohen, 61 NY2d 261, 274 [1984]).
We further note that the court should not have permitted the defendants’ attorney to submit Higgs’ examination before trial into evidence. Upon the record presented, defendants failed to make a sufficient showing that such deposition was admissible pursuant to CPLR 3117 (a) (3) (ii).",0
0646-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Matthew F. Cooper, J.
The defendant, a 17-year-old high school student, was arrested on April 7, 2003, while participating in a demonstration against the war in Iraq. The target of the demonstration was the Carlyle Group, which has an office at 712 Fifth Avenue. Critics contend that the Carlyle Group, a private global investment firm, stands to profit from the war.
The complaint alleges that the defendant blocked the “normal flow of pedestrian traffic” by lying on the ground in front of 712 Fifth Avenue and then refused to stand up when told she was under arrest. As a result, the defendant is charged with one count of obstruction of governmental administration in the second degree, in violation of Penal Law § 195.05, and two counts of disorderly conduct, in violation of Penal Law § 240.20 (5) and (6). The first count is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in jail, while the second and third counts are violations punishable by a maximum of 15 days in jail.
The defendant moves to dismiss the information in the interest of justice, an application commonly known as a Clayton motion. (See People v Clayton, 41 AD2d 204 [2d Dept 1973].) The remedy of dismissal in the interest of justice, while having a “respected place in the common law” (People v Rickert, 58 NY2d 122, 126 [1983]), is now governed by Criminal Procedure Law § 170.40 (1). The statute, which was amended in 1979, authorizes a court to dismiss an accusatory instrument when “such dismissal is required as a matter of judicial discretion by the existence of some compelling factor, consideration or circumstance clearly demonstrating that conviction or prosecution of the defendant upon such accusatory instrument or count would constitute or result in injustice.” (CPL 170.40 [1].)
Criminal Procedure Law § 170.40 (1) sets forth the following 10 factors to be examined and considered by the court in making its determination as to whether injustice would result from prosecution or conviction:
“(a) the seriousness and circumstances of the offense;
“(b) the extent of harm caused by the offense;
“(c) the evidence of guilt, whether admissible or inadmissible at trial;
“(d) the history, character and condition of the defendant;
“(e) any exceptionally serious misconduct of law enforcement personnel in the investigation, arrest and prosecution of the defendant;
“(f) the purpose and effect of imposing upon the defendant a sentence authorized for the offense;
“(g) the impact of dismissal upon the safety and welfare of the community;
“(h) the impact of dismissal upon the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system;
“(i) where the court deems it appropriate, the attitude of the complainant or victim with respect to the motion; [and]
“(j) any other relevant fact indicating that a judgment of conviction would have no usefiil purpose.”
When deciding a motion to dismiss in the interest of justice, it is not necessary to engage in a point-by-point “catechistic” discussion of all 10 factors listed under Criminal Procedure Law § 170.40 (1). (Rickert, 58 NY2d at 128.) Instead, the court is required to consider the factors “individually and collectively” in making a value judgment that is based upon striking a sensitive balance between the interests of the individual and those of the state. (People v Harmon, 181 AD2d 34, 35 [1st Dept 1992].) In so doing, the court must be mindful that its power to grant the relief is neither absolute nor uncontrolled (see People v Wingard, 33 NY2d 192, 196 [1973]), and that such power should be exercised “sparingly.” (People v Howard, 151 AD2d 253, 256 [1989], lv denied 74 NY2d 811 [1989].)
A good indication as to just how sparingly the power is to be exercised is the very small number of reported cases where motions to dismiss in the interest of justice have been granted. And, it would seem, in those relatively rare instances where trial courts have exercised their discretion in favor of dismissal, appellate courts have more often than not seen fit to reverse. One such appellate decision, People v Arbeiter (169 Misc 2d 771 [App Term, 1st Dept 1996]), is of particular significance with regard to the case before me.
In Arbeiter, the prosecution appealed from an order of the Criminal Court dismissing all charges brought against 90 members of the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization (ILGO). The charges, resisting arrest (Penal Law § 205.30) and disorderly conduct, stemmed from the defendants’ participation in what has become ILGO’s traditional protest at the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade. While affirming the dismissal of the resisting charges on the grounds of facial insufficiency, the Appellate Term, in a rather sharply worded decision, found that there was no basis for the trial court to have dismissed the disorderly conduct charges in the interest of justice. In reinstating the disorderly conduct charges, the court agreed with the prosecution that even though the defendants’ actions were motivated by the sincerity of their beliefs, “sincere beliefs are not an excuse for lawless conduct.” (Arbeiter, 169 Misc 2d at 773.) In the court’s view, a dismissal in the interest of justice “might have an adverse impact upon public confidence in the criminal justice system,” particularly where it concerned “conduct that past experience has taught is likely to keep recurring.” (Arbeiter, 169 Misc 2d at 773.)
With the notion firmly ingrained that relief should be sparingly granted and with the decision of the Appellate Term in mind, I nevertheless believe that the defendant’s motion to dismiss the charges in the interest of justice should be granted. As I will further explain, there are factors and circumstances presented here that are substantially different from those in Arbeiter and serve to make this one of those “rare” and “unusual” cases that “cries out for fundamental justice beyond the confines of conventional considerations.” (People v Insignares, 109 AD2d 221, 234 [1st Dept 1985], citing People v Beige, 46 NY2d 60, 62-63 [1976].)
In making my decision, I have first taken into account the defendant’s background, character and age. The defendant does not have a criminal record, this being the only time she has ever been arrested. She is an honor student bound for college in Ohio on a merit scholarship. The numerous letters submitted with her motion attest to her extensive volunteer work and involvement in community groups. She is lauded by her teachers, employers, friends and neighbors as a young person who is greatly concerned about others and keenly intent on making a positive contribution to our country and to the world. And while “[t]he fact that a defendant may have had no prior criminal record and an exemplary background, standing alone, is insufficient to justify a dismissal in the interest of justice” (People v Diggs, 125 AD2d 189, 191 [1st Dept 1986]), it is certainly of significance in the overall determination. (See CPL 170.40 [1] [d].)
What makes the factor that much more compelling in this instance is the defendant’s age. The defendant may indeed show a greater commitment and sense of purpose than many teenagers, but the fact remains that she is only 17. She is too young to vote in an election, drink alcoholic beverages, enlist in the armed forces, buy a laser pointer or a can of spray paint, marry without both parental and judicial consent, or enter into a legally binding contract. This is because we, as a society, recognize that a person of the defendant’s age, while mature in many ways, still cannot be expected to exercise the same degree of judgment that we demand from an adult. In this vein, the defendant’s actions at the protest on April 7, to the extent that they may have been unlawful, are more readily seen as resulting from youth and inexperience than from wilful criminality. (See People v Gordon, 89 AD2d 912 [2d Dept 1982]; People v Cruickshank, 105 AD2d 325 [3d Dept 1985].)
Turning next to the defendant’s actions themselves, I have considered the offenses charged in terms of their seriousness, the harm caused and the evidence of guilt. (See CPL 170.40 [1] [a], [b], [c].) There is little question that the defendant’s actions as alleged in the information constitute disorderly conduct in violation of Penal Law § 240.20 (5). By the same token, it is equally clear that the “seriousness of the offense” and the “extent of harm caused by the offense” are, in the scheme of things, decidedly minor. The defendant lay down on a sidewalk in midtown on a weekday morning and stayed there when ordered to move. This, we are told, “blocked the normal flow of pedestrian traffic,” forced “pedestrians to walk around the defendant” and caused “public inconvenience.”
The impact of the defendant’s act of lying on the sidewalk seems a far cry from what is described as having occurred in People v Arbeiter. There, the defendants, by blocking the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, “snarled traffic for an hour and a half and caused delay and inconvenience for an untold number of . . . New Yorkers.” (Arbeiter, 169 Misc 2d at 772-773.) Nothing even remotely approaching such gridlock appears to have resulted here. All that happened is that pedestrians had to walk around the defendant.
It is difficult to envision New Yorkers, renown for their ability to cope in the face of adversity, being particularly disturbed by encountering the defendant lying on the sidewalk and having to sidestep her. Impediments to the free flow of pedestrian traffic are a hallmark of city life. What with street vendors, people distributing leaflets, newspaper vending machines, food carts, coffee wagons, sidewalk seating, scaffolding, construction barriers, pavement excavations and groups of smokers in front of smoke-free buildings, one hardly expects to walk along a busy midtown street with an uninterrupted stride. In this instance, people may very well have been inconvenienced by the defendant’s actions, but it could not have been that much more than the routine inconvenience we endure in this city on a regular basis.
Moreover, it is questionable whether the more serious charge of obstruction of governmental administration is sufficient as a matter of law. Although the issue of facial sufficiency is not before me, I find the allegations in the information — namely, that “when members of the New York City Police Department instructed defendant he [sic] was under arrest and to stand up, defendant failed to do so” — problematic at best. Nowhere in the information is there any suggestion of the “intimidation, physical force or interference” or the “independently unlawful act” needed to establish the elements of the crime of obstruction of governmental administration. (See Penal Law § 195.05.) The information does not state that the defendant went limp or even that she had to be carried out to the police van, an allegation that the Appellate Term in Arbeiter found insufficient to establish the closely related charge of resisting arrest. The information here simply states that at some point — and for some unspecified duration — the defendant refused to stand up. The fact that the obstruction charge may not even be sustainable on its face — let alone provable beyond a reasonable doubt — goes to a distinct lack of “evidence of guilt” and further favors dismissal in the interest of justice.
An additional compelling, albeit unusual, circumstance presented by this case is the loss of liberty that the defendant experienced as a result of an error on the part of the court and the prosecution. Following her arraignment, the defendant was released on her own recognizance and told to return to court on June 11, 2003. On that date, the defendant appeared with her attorney and a motion schedule was set. The transcript of the proceedings shows that the case was adjourned to July 25, 2003 for response and decision. Unfortunately, the handwritten entry made on the file by the judge presiding that day was misconstrued by the court staff to be July 23. As a result, the defendant’s case was erroneously calendered for July 23 instead of July 25.
On July 23, the case was called but the defendant, rightfully believing as she did that her court date was not until two days later, was not present. Upon the Assistant District Attorney’s request, the court ordered a bench warrant for the defendant’s arrest.
On the morning of July 25, 2003, as the defendant prepared to make her scheduled court appearance, she was seized by warrant officers and brought into court in handcuffs. With her mother present in the courtroom, she was then chained to the bench until her case was called. When the case was called, it became clear that the warrant had been issued in error. Although the warrant was expunged, the defendant nevertheless suffered the indignity and trauma of being wrongfully placed in custody.
The unjustified deprivation of the defendant’s liberty does not fall squarely within any of the specific statutory criteria under Criminal Procedure Law § 170.40 (1). It does, however, touch on several of the paragraphs outlined in the statute, including paragraph (f). By being returned on the erroneous warrant and being placed in custody, the defendant was, for all intents and purposes, incarcerated. This is significant because even if convicted of the misdemeanor, the defendant, who is 17 years old, must be mandatorily adjudicated a youthful offender. As a youthful offender, it is inconceivable that the defendant would be sentenced to any jail time. Thus, due to the erroneous warrant, the defendant has already suffered a “punishment” far greater than what would have resulted from her conviction in this case. Finally, the defendant’s loss of liberty is a “relevant fact” under paragraph (j), the “catchall” factor, that further tips the balance of the equities in favor of a dismissal in the interest of justice.
Reference has been made throughout this decision to People v Arbeiter. This is because the defendant in this case and the defendants there were charged with either the same or similar offenses and because both cases are “protest cases.” In terms, however, of the factors to be considered in determining whether a case is appropriate for dismissal in the interest of justice, this case is closer to People v Wingard (33 NY2d 192 [1973]). Although the decision predates the amendment of Criminal Procedure Law § 170.40 (1), it is still widely cited for its discussion of the principles underlying such a dismissal. In Wingard, the Court of Appeals found dismissal in the interest of justice to be appropriate in a disorderly conduct case based on the fact that the “youthful defendants” were charged with violations “causative of neither damage nor injury,” that they would have to return for trial and lose time from school, and that they had been detained in court under circumstances that were “inexcusable and unjustified.” (Wingard, 33 NY2d at 196.) All of these factors are present in this case.
Finally, the concern expressed by the Appellate Term in Arbeiter that dismissal would have a negative impact on the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system does not seem applicable here. Where in Arbeiter the court could foresee that unlawful conduct would take place each year and that arrests would regularly ensue, here there is no indication that the defendant will continue to engage in the type of actions that resulted in her arrest. In fact, as her attorney states in the motion papers, the defendant can be expected to learn from the experience and continue to work for the causes she believes in without violating the law.
Unlike many nations, we pride ourselves on our willingness to hear the voices of dissent. Protest, in its many forms, has a hallowed place in our democracy and is very much a part of our American spirit. It is one of the great strengths of our society. And certainly our society is strong enough to recognize the mitigating circumstances present here and forego the prosecution of this young woman.
Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss the information in the interest of justice is granted.
. It is less clear whether the defendant’s actions as alleged constitute disorderly conduct under Penal Law § 240.20 (6). A requisite element of Penal Law § 240.20 (6) is that the defendant “congregate[ ] with [an]other,” and no such allegation is set forth in the information.
. It appears that the People, having been foreclosed by Arbeiter from charging resisting arrest in passive resistance protest cases, have resorted to utilizing obstruction of governmental administration in the second degree as a “substitute” misdemeanor.",0

On July 14, 2003 CPLR 8020 (a), as amended by Laws of 2003 (ch 62, § 25), permitted the County Clerk to collect a New York fee for the filing of any motion or cross motion, stipulation of settlement, or voluntary discontinuance.
Lawrence Cullen, Esq., the guardian ad litem in the above-captioned action, filed a motion on October 20, 2003 to settle the final accounting in the guardianship proceeding. Mr. Cullen was advised by the guardianship clerk that the motion requires payment of a $45 fee. Mr. Cullen seeks an order directing the County Clerk of Queens County to accept the motion without payment of fees enacted by chapter 62 of the Laws of 2003.
Mr. Cullen, an attorney, was appointed guardian ad litem by this court on October 9, 2002 and charged with protecting the rights and interests of Rosemary Masi, to conduct a full investigation of the financial proceedings, marshal any assets and prepare a final account.
Inasmuch as there are no longer any assets to benefit Rosemary Masi, there is no reasonable expectation that Mr. Cullen will be compensated for the extraordinary time and effort expended to assist the court in this matter. To demand that he and other similarly situated attorneys pay fees from their own personal funds is not just onerous but beyond the pale.
It is clear and generally accepted that court examiners, as appointees of a public officer, are deemed to be an “arm of the court” and as such are exempt from the payment of fees. No valid distinction can be made between a court examiner and a guardian, guardian ad litem and other similar appointees who are charged with investigating, advising the court, preparing final accountings and performing other statutory duties in a guardianship proceeding. Both are appointed by and for the purpose of performing essential functions of a public officer.
The intention behind the imposition of fees was to raise funds and perhaps discourage frivolous motions. This justifiably applies to all parties who seek a benefit from the result of a motion, cross motion or stipulation. Such is not the case for attorneys acting at the behest of the court. Judges presiding in the guardianship parts have come to rely upon the largess and honorable efforts of attorneys who practice elder law, such as Mr. Cullen.
While these attorneys can be expected to perform work without compensation, they cannot be expected to pay for the privilege of doing so. The inevitable result of requiring fees from a guardian, guardian ad litem, court evaluators or other individuals performing similar functions, would be the wholesale refusal by attorneys to accept such appointments, causing the entire guardianship part to grind to a frightening halt. This cannot be allowed to happen.
Therefore, all motions, cross motions or applications made by a guardian, guardian ad litem, court-appointed attorney, or court evaluator in proceedings in which there are no assets must be exempt from the payment of fees. The Clerk of Queens County is directed to accept for filing the instant application without the payment of any fee imposed by chapter 62 of the Laws of 2003.
The guardian ad litem is directed to serve a copy of this order with his ex parte application and motion for a final accounting upon the Clerk of Queens County who shall process same in accordance with the foregoing.",0

Howard A. Ruditzky, J.
Plaintiff American Transit Insurance Company moves, pursuant to CPLR 3212, for an order granting summary judgment declaring that it is not obligated to defend or indemnify Yoon Kim or pay for any judgment rendered against Kim in the action commenced against Kim by Marissa Fuentes under Kings County Index No. 33827/01.
Background and Procedural History
The record reveals that on April 7, 2001, a motor vehicle owned and operated by Kim came into contact with a vehicle owned by Perlina Archibald and operated by Omar Blackwell, in which Marissa Fuentes was a passenger. An action was commenced by Fuentes against Kim, Blackwell and Archibald (the Fuentes action). Kim’s vehicle was insured under a policy issued by American Transit. American Transit appointed Norman Volk & Associates as counsel to represent Kim in the Fuentes action. Kim signed an authorization, dated November 20, 2001, authorizing Norman Volk to appear and interpose an answer on his behalf, which it did.
On April 30, 2002, Kim made a motion before this court seeking the disqualification of Norman Volk as his counsel. It appears that Kim sought the removal because he felt that relevant information and documentation was not being provided to him from Norman Volk. In response to Kim’s motion, American Transit submitted an affidavit from Richard Carroll, manager of its Claims Department, explaining that American Transit appoints counsel and controls the litigation and that, although there was no basis for disqualification, it would be willing to appoint alternate counsel if Kim would consent. In addition, American Transit sent a letter to Earn, dated May 30, 2002, informing him of its offer to provide substitute counsel and attached a “Consent to Change Counsel Form.” The letter also stated that “[y]our policy gives us the sole right to conduct your defense and determine when, and if, to settle your case. Accordingly, you will be in breach of your policy if you represent yourself and we will disclaim all coverage, meaning that you will not have any insurance coverage for any liability you have for the accident.”
However, the record reveals that Kim pursued his motion to disqualify Norman Volk. By order dated June 11, 2002, this court granted Kim’s motion after carefully explaining to Kim that as a result of this order, Kim may no longer be covered by American Transit for the accident.
American Transit’s Motion
American Transit now moves for summary judgment declaring that it is not obligated to defend or indemnify Kim and that plaintiff is not required to pay for any judgment rendered against Kim in the Fuentes action. American Transit argues that Kim’s refusal to allow American Transit to direct his defense, as well as Kim’s decision to proceed in the underlying action on a pro se basis, is in direct violation of the cooperation clause contained in the policy and constitutes a breach of his policy. American Transit concludes, as a result, that Kim is no longer entitled to a defense or indemnification by plaintiff in connection with the Fuentes action.
American Transit attaches a copy of its policy with Kim. Section 11 of the policy states in pertinent part:
“The Company [American Transit] shall have the exclusive right to contest or settle any . . . suits or claims. The Insured [Kim] shall not interfere in any way respecting any negotiations for the settlement of any claim or suit, nor in the conduct of any legal proceedings, but shall, at all times, at the request of the Company, render to it all possible cooperation and assistance.”
It is well settled that “[t]o effectively deny insurance coverage based upon lack of cooperation, an insurance carrier must demonstrate (1) that it acted diligently in seeking to bring about the insured’s cooperation, (2) that the efforts employed by the carrier were reasonably calculated to obtain the insured’s cooperation, and (3) that the attitude of the insured, after his cooperation was sought, was one of willful and avowed obstruction” (Physicians’ Reciprocal Insurers v Keller, 243 AD2d 547, 547-548 [1997]; see also Thrasher v United States Liab. Ins. Co., 19 NY2d 159, 168 [1967]; Hyer v Travelers Ins. Co., 297 AD2d 707, 708 [2002]; Baghaloo-White v Allstate Ins. Co., 270 AD2d 296 [2000]; Commercial Union Ins. Co. v Burr, 226 AD2d 416, 417 [1996]; Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. v Soler, 184 AD2d 498, 499 [1992]). Moreover “a very heavy burden is imposed on the insurer to show, in the first instance, that the circumstances support the inference that the insured’s failure to cooperate was deliberate” (Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v 170 E. 106th St. Realty Corp., 212 AD2d 419, 420 [1995]; see Matter of Empire Mut. Ins. Co. [Stroud], 36 NY2d 719, 722 [1975]; Ingarra v General Acc./PG Ins. Co., 273 AD2d 766, 767 [2000]; Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., 184 AD2d at 499; Hanover Ins. Co. v DeMato, 143 AD2d 807, 808 [1988]). Additionally, courts have looked for a “pattern of noncooperation for which no reasonable excuse [is] offered” (Ingarra, 273 AD 2d at 767, quoting Argento v Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 184 AD2d 487, 488 [1992]).
In the instant case, the record reveals that American Transit appointed the firm of Norman Volk to represent Kim pursuant to the express term of his policy and Kim signed an authorization agreeing to said representation. Norman Volk interposed an answer to the summons and complaint on Kim’s behalf. At the time that American Transit became aware of Kim’s attempt to disqualify Norman Volk, American Transit sent correspondence, dated May 30, 2002, informing him that he would be in breach of his policy if he represented himself and that coverage would be disclaimed. This letter further stated that although American Transit disagreed that Norman Volk had done anything warranting its disqualification, new counsel would be appointed in order to resolve Kim’s concerns. American Transit attached a “Consent to Change Counsel Form” designating the firm of Robinson & Cole LLP to be substituted as counsel. Kim refused to accept counsel appointed by American Transit and proceeded with his motion to disqualify. Thus, it appears that American Transit acted diligently in seeking to bring about Kim’s cooperation and that its efforts were reasonably calculated to obtain Kim’s cooperation (see Thrasher, 19 NY2d at 168; Hyer, 297 AD2d at 708; Baghaloo-White, 270 AD2d at 296; Physicians’ Reciprocal Insurers, 243 AD2d at 548; Commercial Union Ins. Co., 226 AD2d at 417; Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., 184 AD2d at 499). Moreover, Kim’s failure to cooperate was clearly deliberate and without any apparent reasonable justification (see Ingarra, 273 AD2d at 767). Indeed, this court is left to speculate as to the reasons for Kim’s conduct since Efim has chosen not to submit opposition papers to the present motion. Accordingly, the court finds that American Transit has satisfied the burden of demonstrating a wilful lack of cooperation warranting a disclaimer of insurance coverage. As such, American Transit’s motion is granted in its entirety and it is hereby declared that American Transit is not obligated to defend or indemnify Kim.
The court notes that Kim was also informed by the motion court of the consequences of proceeding with his motion (i.e., loss of coverage and defense) but he desired to go forward with the motion to disqualify.",0

Shirley Werner Kornreich, J.
This is a declaratory judgment action. Plaintiff Courtroom Television Network LLC (Court TV) is a “national cable television network dedicated to reporting on legal and judicial systems of the United States, the 50 states, and the District of Columbia.” Court TV seeks a judgment holding New York Civil Rights Law § 52 unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the US Constitution and/or article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution, as well as an order permanently enjoining the statute’s enforcement.
Court TV now moves for partial summary judgment, submitting the affidavit of Douglas P. Jacobs, its executive vice-president and general counsel, copies of pleadings and other documentary evidence. The State of New York and George E. Pataki (State defendants) cross-move for summary judgment dismissing the action. In support of their cross motion, and in opposition to Court TV’s motion, State defendants submit the affidavit of Harriet B. Rosen, Assistant Attorney General in the office of Eliot Spitzer, and other documentary evidence. Defendant Morgenthau also opposes Court TV’s motion.
The court holds that Civil Rights Law § 52 does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution.
Legislative Background
Since 1909, the public’s right to attend trials in New York has been guaranteed by statute. (See Judiciary Law § 4.) Enacted the same year, Civil Rights Law § 12 codifies the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution, protecting criminal defendants’ rights to a fair, public trial. In 1952, the New York Legislature enacted Civil Rights Law § 52, which provides, in pertinent part:
“No person, firm, association or corporation shall televise, broadcast, take motion pictures or arrange for the televising, broadcasting, or taking of motion pictures within this state of proceedings, in which the testimony of witnesses by subpoena or other compulsory , process is or may be taken, conducted by a court, commission, committee, administrative agency or other tribunal in this state . . . .”
A 1962 amendment to section 52 allows audiovisual coverage at specified proceedings of the New York State Legislature and State commissions, provided consent is obtained from the legislative body and the testifying witness and a determination is made by the Legislature that the coverage is “in the public interest.” (See Civil Rights Law § 52.) A second amendment, passed in 1976, permits, under the same protective conditions, televising of “public hearings conducted by the public service commission with regard to rates charged by utilities.” (See id.)
On March 26, 1952, Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed the bill into law, noting:
“It is basic to our concept of justice that a witness compelled to testify have a fair opportunity to present his testimony. No right is more fundamental to our traditional liberties. The use of television, motion pictures and radio at such proceedings impairs this basic right. Batteries of cameras, microphones and glaring lights carry with them attendant excitement, distractions and the potential for improper exploitation and intolerable subversion of the rights of the witness. Official proceedings must not be converted into indecorous spectacles.
“It is difficult enough for the ordinary witness to overcome the nervousness in the presence of a large room full of people, a court, jury or investigating committee and the press. It is impossible if the witness is placed in front of glaring lights and knows he is being seen or heard by millions of people.” (Public Papers of Governor Dewey at 324-325 [1952].)
Court TV posits, and defendants do not dispute, that the passage of Civil Rights Law § 52 should be viewed as part of the “national backlash” engendered by photographic coverage of such notorious cases as the 1935 trial of Bruno Hauptmann in New Jersey. (Complaint 11 38.) Hauptmann was accused of the kidnapping-murder of Charles A. Lindbergh’s 18-month-old son. (See Kielbowicz, The Story Behind the Adoption of the Ban on Courtroom Cameras, 63 Judicature 1, 17 [June-July 1979].) Press coverage substantially disrupted the proceedings. One oft-cited commentator called the trial a “Roman Holiday” where “[p]hotographers clambered on counsel’s table and shoved their flashbulbs into the faces of witnesses.” (Id. at 17.) After newsreel photographers violated strict access restrictions he had imposed, the judge barred any further photographic coverage, and the New Jersey Attorney General demanded that the newsreel companies “withdraw the trial footage from exhibition.” (Id. at 19.) Although two newsreel companies complied with the Attorney General’s demand, two did not. Industry sources estimated that footage of the trial “played in 10,000 of the nation’s 14,000 movie theaters.” (Id.)
Reaction to the Hauptmann trial took the form of efforts by legislators, judges and bar association leaders to ban photographic coverage of court proceedings. (Kielbowicz, supra at 20.) In 1937, the American Bar Association (ABA) adopted Judicial Canon 35, which provided that
“Proceedings in court should be conducted with fitting dignity and decorum. The taking of photographs in the courtroom, during sessions of the court or recesses between sessions, and the broadcasting of court proceedings, degrade the court and create misconceptions with respect thereto in the mind of the public and should not be permitted.” {See id. at 14.)
In 1952, the same year New York enacted Civil Rights Law § 52, the ABA “amended Canon 35 to proscribe televised court proceedings.” (Complaint 1Í 39.)
In 1965, the United States Supreme Court confronted the issue of audiovisual coverage of court proceedings in the case of Estes v Texas (381 US 532 [1965]). The question presented was whether petitioner Billy Sol Estes, a “much-publicized financier” {id. at 552) who stood convicted of “swindling” in the District Court for the Seventh Judicial District of Texas, was deprived of his “right under the Fourteenth Amendment to due process by the televising and broadcasting of his trial.” {Id. at 535.) Justice Clark described the scene at the pretrial hearings on a defense motion to preclude audiovisual coverage:
“All available seats in the courtroom were taken and some 30 persons stood in the aisles . . .
“Cables and wires were snaked across the courtroom floor, three microphones were on the judge’s bench and others were beamed at the jury box and the counsel table. It is conceded that the activities of the television crews and news photographers led to considerable disruption of the hearings . . . All of this two-day affair was highly publicized and could only have impressed those present, and also the community at large, with the notorious character of the petitioner as well as the proceeding.” {Id. at 535-537.)
The Court in Estes held that conditions during the pretrial hearing and the trial itself violated the petitioner’s due process right to a fair trial. {See id. at 543.) Particularly troubling to the Court was the potential, but immeasurable, prejudice on the minds of the jurors arising whenever a notorious trial, by virtue of being televised, becomes a “cause ce le bre.” {Estes, supra at 551.) The Court also was concerned that in such cases jurors would be “distracted,” not only by the physical aspects of audiovisual coverage (which the State in Estes argued were de minimis), but also by the “awareness of the fact of telecasting that is felt by the juror throughout the trial.” {Id. at 546.) In this connection, the Court observed that “[w]e are all self-conscious and uneasy when being televised.” {Id.) Other potential risks addressed by the Court were the impairment of witness testimony, the administrative burden on the trial judge, and the mental “harassment” of the defendant caused by “inevitable close-ups of his gestures and expressions during the ordeal of his trial.” {Id. at 549.) The Court in Estes rejected the State’s argument that no constitutional violation could be found because the defendant did not make a “showing of actual prejudice.” {Id. at 542.) Instead, the Court held that the case was one in which “a procedure employed by the State involves such a probability that prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process” even without an actual showing of prejudice to the defendant. {Id. at 542-543; but see Estes, supra at 587 [Harlan, J., concurring] [limiting the holding in Estes to “what was done in this case”].)
“In the mid-1970s, State courts began authorizing broadcast coverage of judicial proceedings, on either an experimental or permanent basis.” (1994 Report of Fed Jud Ctr, Electronic Media Coverage of Federal Civil Proceedings: An Evaluation of the Pilot Program in Six District Courts and Two Courts of Appeal [FJC Report], at 3.) For example, in 1977, the Florida Supreme Court initiated a pilot program allowing the electronic media to televise and photograph civil and criminal judicial proceedings in all courts of the State of Florida, subject to specific restrictions on types of equipment, light and noise levels, camera placement and audio pickup, and subject to the “reasonable orders and direction of the presiding trial judge in any such proceedings.” (In re Petition of Post-Newsweek Stas., 347 So 2d 402, 403 [Fla 1977].) After reviewing the results of the pilot program, the Florida Supreme Court decided that the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct should be amended to allow audiovisual coverage of trials, subject to the trial judge’s authority to conduct the proceedings so as to ensure a fair trial. {See Complaint 11 50.)
In 1980, the Judicial Council of California initiated a pilot program authorizing audiovisual coverage of trial and appellate court proceedings. {Id. 11 51.) A report submitted to the California Chief Justice’s Special Committee on the Courts and the media by an independent consultant found that the “postulated distraction-decorum effects,” such as witness distraction, attorney grandstanding or general disorder, had generally not occurred during the pilot program. (See affidavit of W. Burrell, exhibit K, at 243.) After reviewing the results of the pilot program, which was extended twice, California enacted rules authorizing audiovisual coverage of court proceedings. (See complaint 1 55; see also Cal Rules of Court rule 980 [2003].)
Neither Florida nor California made the decision to allow audiovisual coverage on constitutional grounds. When the Florida Supreme Court revised its Canon 3A (7) to permit audiovisual coverage, it did so “upon its supervisory authority over the Florida courts, and not upon any constitutional imperative.” (See Chandler v Florida, 449 US 560, 569-570 [1981].) Similarly, in adopting rule 980 of the California Rules of Court in 1984, California’s Judicial Council was aware of the important constitutional issues surrounding the issue, but based its decision, instead, on “the court’s inherent right to control access.” (See KFMB-TV Channel 8 v Municipal Ct., 221 Cal App 3d 1362, 1366, 271 Cal Rptr 109, 111 [4th Dist 1990].)
More or less contemporaneously with state court developments, the ABA Committee on Fair Trial-Free Press “proposed revised standards” to Canon 3A (7), the successor to Canon 35, whereby courtroom coverage by electronic media would be permitted “under conditions to be established by local rule and under the control of the trial judge.” (See Chandler, supra at 564.) The revision was rejected by the ABA House of Delegates on February 12, 1979, but Canon 3A (7) was ultimately amended in 1982 to permit electronic coverage of court proceedings under “guidelines which allow such coverage in a manner that will be unobtrusive, will not distract the trial participants, and will not otherwise interfere with the administration of justice.” (See Ranji, Cameras Come to Court, Natl LJ, Jan. 30, 1984, at 1.) In 1978, the “Conference of State Chief Justices, by a vote of 44 to 1, approved a resolution to allow the highest court of each state to promulgate standards and guidelines regulating radio, television, and other photographic coverage of court proceedings.” (See Chandler, supra at 564.)
From 1980 to 1986, the United States Supreme Court decided several cases bearing on the issue of cameras in the courtroom. In Chandler (supra), the Court upheld the constitutionality of Florida’s Judicial Canon 3A (7) authorizing judges to permit audiovisual coverage of court proceedings, even over the objection of the defendant in a criminal case. The Chandler court viewed Florida’s decision to allow audiovisual coverage of court proceedings as “an exercise of authority reserved to the states under our federalism.” (Id. at 578.) The Court held that Florida’s Canon was not per se unconstitutional, reasoning that its decision in Estes (supra) did not impose a per se constitutional ban on televising court proceedings. (See Chandler, supra at 574, citing Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Estes.) Though the appellants’ trial in Chandler had attracted substantial publicity, the Court held that the appellants made “no showing that the trial was compromised by television coverage, as was the case in Estes.” (Id. at 582.)
In a “quartet” of cases beginning with Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v Virginia (448 US 555 [1980]), and culminating in Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct. (478 US 1 [1986] [Press-Enterprise II]), the Court held that the First Amendment to the US Constitution implicitly guarantees the public (including the press) a right to attend criminal trial proceedings. Richmond involved the fourth attempt by the State of Virginia to try the defendant for second degree murder, the first having yielded a conviction which was overturned because of improperly admitted evidence, and the subsequent two having ended in mistrials. The Court in Richmond held that the trial judge could not constitutionally close the fourth trial to the public, even where neither party objected to the closure, “without any demonstration that closure is required to protect the defendant’s superior right to a fair trial, or that some other overriding consideration requires closure.” (Richmond, supra at 564.) In explaining how it derived an “unarticulated right” of access from the First Amendment, the Richmond court invoked the “history of criminal trials being presumptively open since long before the Constitution,” and held that “the First Amendment guarantees of speech and press, standing alone, prohibit government from summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time that Amendment was adopted.” (Id. at 575-576.)
Two years after Richmond, the Court in Globe Newspaper Co. v Superior Ct. (457 US 596 [1982]) held unconstitutional as applied a Massachusetts statute requiring the judge at “trials for specified sexual offenses involving a victim under the age of 18, to exclude the press and general public from the courtroom during the testimony of that victim.” (Id. at 598.) In a trial for the rape of three underage girls, the judge ordered the courtroom closed to the public, relying on the statute. Applying strict scrutiny, the Court agreed with the State that its interest in “safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor” was compelling, but held that the statute was not a “narrowly tailored means” of accommodating that interest, because the interest could be “served just as well by requiring the trial court to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the State’s legitimate concern for the well-being of the minor victim necessitates closure.” (Id. at 608-609.) On the other hand, the Globe court restated what it said in Richmond, that “[o]f course, limitations on the right of access that resemble ‘time, place, and manner’ restrictions on protected speech would not be subjected to such strict scrutiny.” (See id. at 607 n 17 [citations omitted], quoting Young v American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 US 50, 63 n 18 [1976], and citing Richmond, supra at 581-582 n 18.) Rounding out the quartet, the Court in Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct. (464 US 501 [1984] [Press-Enterprise I]) and Press-Enterprise II (supra) expanded the scope of Richmond and Globe to encompass a trial judge’s closure of voir dire proceedings and pretrial hearings in a criminal case.
During the early 1980s, efforts were made in the New York State Legislature to develop legislation amending Civil Rights Law § 52 to allow cameras in the trial courts. (See DiLello, Issues In Focus, Senate Research Service, Apr. 20, 1995, at 4 [Issues].) In 1982, the Chief Judge of New York promulgated rules authorizing audiovisual coverage of court proceedings. (See 22 NYCRR 29.1 et seq.) The rules provided for “electronic photographic recording of proceedings” in appellate courts. In addition, the rules authorized audiovisual coverage of trial court proceedings pending the Legislature’s removal of the ban imposed by Civil Rights Law § 52.
The New York Legislature’s Experiment With Audiovisual Coverage of Trials
On January 7, 1987, the New York State Legislature acted for the first time to lift section 52’s ban on audiovisual coverage in trial court proceedings. Judiciary Law § 218 provided for audiovisual coverage on an experimental basis. In enacting the law, the Legislature stated:
“[I]n order to enhance public familiarity with the workings of the judicial system, while not interfering with the dignity and decorum of the courtroom, the prohibition of audio-visual coverage of court proceedings should be modified for an experimental period. Accordingly, this act authorizes the chief judge of the state to permit limited, judicially supervised audio-visual coverage of civil and criminal court proceedings for a period of eighteen months, and requires the chief administrator of the courts to report to the legislature, the governor and the chief judge on the effect of such coverage on the state’s judicial system.” (L 1987, ch 113, § 1.)
Judiciary Law § 218 was signed into law on June 15, 1987 by Governor Mario Cuomo. The law provided for audiovisual coverage “upon reasonable [written] notice” and subject to the trial judge’s continuing discretion. In exercising discretion, the judge was required to consider all of the following factors: “(i) the type of case involved; (ii) whether such coverage would cause harm to any participant in the case or otherwise interfere with the fair administration of justice, the advancement of a fair trial or the rights of the parties; (iii) whether such coverage would interfere with any law enforcement activity; or (iv) [whether it would] involve lewd or scandalous matters.” (See L 1987, ch 113, § 2, adding Judiciary Law § 218 [former (3) (d)].) Consent of “counsel, parties, jurors or witnesses” was not required for audiovisual coverage. (§ 218 [former (5)].) Notwithstanding the judge’s discretion, audiovisual coverage of the following was prohibited: conferences among cocounsel, between counsel and their clients, and between counsel and the judge; conferences in chambers; jury selection and the jury during trial; undercover police witnesses; victims of sexual abuse crimes; and any coverage “liable to endanger the safety of any person.” (§ 218 [7] [former (h)].) At the conclusion of audiovisually covered proceedings, the trial judge and counsel of record were required to file with the chief administrator “a report assessing the effect of such coverage upon the proceedings.” (§ 218 [former (9)].)
Pursuant to section 218, rules were “promulgated to comport with the legislative finding that an enhanced public understanding of the judicial system is important in maintaining a high level of public confidence in the Judiciary, and with the legislative concern that cameras in the courts be compatible with the fair administration of justice.” (See 22 NYCRR 131.1 [a].) The rules, amended in 1989 and 1992, govern audiovisual coverage of trial court proceedings during “any period when audio-visual coverage in the trial courts is authorized by law.” (See 22 NYCRR 131.1 [b].) For the most part, the rules track the language of Judiciary Law § 218. In addition, the rules provide trial judges specific guidance, for example, setting forth guidelines with respect to determining applications for audiovisual coverage and the use and deployment of equipment and personnel by the news media. (See id. §§ 131.4, 131.7.)
With the passage of Judiciary Law § 218, the Legislature began an experiment that would last approximately 10 years, encompassing three separate extensions of section 218 and generating four accompanying reports with recommendations. Each report recommended permanently removing section 52’s ban on audiovisual coverage. After each report, the Legislature did not follow the report’s recommendation. The first three times the Legislature extended the experiment for another period. After the fourth experimental period, the Legislature allowed Judiciary Law § 218 to expire without extension.
The First Experiment
Judiciary Law § 218 directed the chief administrator of the courts to report on the experiment and provide recommendations on future legislation. (See L 1987, .ch 113, § 3.) Accordingly, Chief Administrative Judge Albert M. Rosenblatt filed a report in March 1989 (Rosenblatt Report). The report was based on input from an advisory committee, surveys of participants in televised trials, comments received at public hearings, and review of “much of the actual content of the pertinent published and televised material.” (Rosenblatt Report at 1.)
The method of surveying trial participants was to review responses elicited in forms developed and distributed by the chief administrator. (Id. at 1.) Judges and counsel of record in trials with audiovisual coverage were required by Judiciary Law § 218 to fill out the forms; the responses of other trial participants and the media were taken on a voluntary basis. A total of 1,095 responses was received, including 525 from judges, 370 from attorneys, 168 from media representatives and 32 from witnesses. The report found that “four times as many judge respondents were favorable than were unfavorable.” (Id, at 50.) “Attorneys in the study were less favorable than judges, but only about a third of the attorneys were negative towards the process.” (Id. at 51.) “The media respondents who chose to participate in the study were highly satisfied with the process . . . (Id.) “For the small sample of witness respondents, twice as many were favorable to media coverage as were unfavorable. While about one-fourth of witness respondents reported feeling anxious and nervous because of the presence of equipment, three-fourths were of the opinion that the coverage did not create undesirable noise and distractions. A very small proportion of witnesses felt that the presence of coverage made them reluctant to testify.” (Id.)
Public hearings were held and public submissions received. Several trends are evident from these responses. The most uniform responses came from the press: 31 out of 31 press representatives voiced strong support for audiovisual coverage of trial proceedings. Six out of nine judges who testified were in support of the experiment. Among attorneys, views on the experiment appeared to be strongly correlated with their clients’ interests. Five out of six attorneys testifying on behalf of district attorneys’ offices supported the experiment. Nine out of nine attorneys who testified for a legal aid or public defender organization were opposed or voiced serious concerns. Private practice attorneys expressed varying views.
The Rosenblatt Report observed that the experiment did not alter some of the fundamental views underlying the issue of audiovisual coverage. The report found that “advocates of cameras maintain — as they did before the experiment — that coverage ... is an opportunity to present actual courtroom proceedings to viewers, many of whom have never seen a proceeding, and that even modest glimpses enable the public to see and learn more than they do without cameras.” (Id. at 101.) On the other hand, “[t]he opponents of courtroom cameras assert — as they did before the experiment began — that most coverage is in the form of newscast snippets ill-suited to true edification . . . .” (Id.) Prophetically, the report surmised that “[t]hese lines of advocacy have remained largely intact, and will no doubt continue to generate debate.” (Id.)
The Rosenblatt Report drew the following conclusions. First, “the effects of coverage upon participants, its impact upon the tranquility and orderliness of the trial, the administrative burdens, and other concerns . . . have been addressed and have not been shown to adversely affect the administration of justice.” (Id. at 103.) Second, while it was “extremely difficult, if not impossible, to measure educational value in a strictly didactic sense . . . [s]eeing and hearing courtroom scenes, even without gaining textbook type knowledge has clear and compelling benefits.” (Id. at 104.) Responding to “[cjlaims that stress the possibility of harmful effects on such valued rights as the presumption of innocence,” the report found that “[t]he weight of opinion . . . does not support the proposition that coverage, per se, compromises those rights . . . (Id. at 105.) With regard to “courtroom noise and disturbance,” the report found that “[t]he evils of the Lindbergh case are safely behind us, at least so far as the courtroom is concerned.” (Id. at 106 [emphasis in original].) Accordingly, the report concluded that “[t]he information gathered during this ‘experiment’ demonstrates that audio-visual coverage does not adversely affect judicial proceedings.” (Id. at 112.) The report, therefore, endorsed audiovisual coverage of trial court proceedings consistent with “the concept of judicial discretion, in preference to unfettered coverage, outright exclusion, veto power by a party or witness, or a presumption for or against coverage.” (Id. at 111.)
The Rosenblatt Report was challenged by various groups and legislators. For example, on May 12, 1989, in response to the experiment and the Rosenblatt Report, the New York State Defenders Association (Defenders) published a report entitled “The Intrusion of Cameras in New York’s Criminal Courts: A Report by the Public Defense Backup Center” (Defenders Report). The Defenders Report criticized the methodology of the Rosenblatt Report and argued that “the Legislature should immediately and permanently terminate the cameras in the courts experiment.” (Affidavit of H. Rosen, exhibit 6, at 31.) The Defenders argued that the self-reporting method of questionnaires shed light only on the attitudes of participants, and failed to provide “information on the actual psychological effects of cameras on trial participants.” (Id. at 22 [emphasis in original].) Moreover, the Defenders pointed out that the surveys were of doubtful value because, due to the failure of the Office of Court Administration to “track distribution of the surveys, it is impossible to determine whether the data collected were obtained from a representative sample of individuals.” (Id. at 23.) The Defenders also observed that the sample of witnesses was minuscule. (Id.)
The Second Experiment
In the context of challenges to the Rosenblatt Report, the Legislature amended Judiciary Law § 218, authorizing a second experimental period of 24 months, beginning June 1, 1989. (See L 1989, ch 115.) The primary revisions to the statute were a seven-day notice requirement; consent requirements in the context of midtrial requests for coverage, arraignments and at suppression hearings; a provision requiring attorneys to advise all witnesses of their right to request an exemption from coverage; and the creation of an advisory committee to be composed of five members, at least two of whom were required to be “by professional training or expertise, qualified to design a research methodology relevant to analyzing the impact and effect of audio-visual coverage of judicial proceedings.” (Id. § 5.) The amended statute provided for a second report by the chief administrator of the courts, which would be required to “utilize the methodological design developed by the advisory committee and the chief administrator, and shall include an analysis and conclusions as to the impact and effect of audio-visual coverage of judicial proceedings upon defendants, witnesses, jurors, prospective jurors and other participants in such proceedings.” (Id. §9.)
The second report was delivered in March 1991 (Crosson Report). An advisory committee, chaired by Judge William C. Donnino, was formed in 1989. (See Crosson Report at [iv].) The advisory committee spent six months developing a new set of “individually-tailored evaluation forms for judges, attorneys, witnesses, jurors, and the media.” (Id.) The report noted that “[f]rom the first phase of the experiment to the second, the number of camera coverage orders granted dropped from 731 to 284,” attributing the decrease to the amendment prohibiting camera coverage of arraignments. (Id. at [v].)
However, the Crosson Report found that the responses of trial participants were congruent with those of the first experiment. (Id. at [v].) “During both experiments judges consistently reported that they were favorable toward audio-visual coverage and that the presence of cameras did not adversely impact upon the proceedings.” (Id. at 64.) Attorney responses also were consistent with the first experiment. In the first experiment, 43% of attorneys who responded were in favor, 25% were opposed and 32% were neutral. (Id. at 66.) In the second experiment, 38% were in favor, 28% were opposed and 33% were neutral. (Id.) In the first experiment, 14% of attorney respondents felt that coverage made witnesses reluctant to testify; in the second experiment, the proportion was 15%. (Id.) Similarly, a majority of responding witnesses in the second experiment were favorable to coverage (43%), or neutral (24%); in the first experiment, the proportions were 55% favorable and 20% neutral. (Id. at 67.) In the second experiment, 81% of witnesses were not distracted by the coverage and 39% felt that the proceeding was not disrupted, while 48% were neutral. (Id.) In the first experiment, 78% of responding witnesses did not think coverage created “undesirable noise or visual distractions, while 72% felt operators and equipment were unobtrusive.” (Id.) Finally, media respondents were “overwhelmingly positive . . . across the two experimental periods.” (Id. at 68.)
Public hearings were held and written submissions accepted. Many of those appearing or writing had testified at the public hearings on the first experiment. The comments summarized in the Crosson Report demonstrate the same basic trends revealed at the public hearings in the first experiment. Press representatives again were unanimous in their support for audiovisual coverage. Attorneys had varied views, but. those representing public defenders or legal aid organizations tended to oppose coverage, while those representing district attorneys tended to support it. As in the first experiment, a proportionally small number of comments were received from private individuals or organizations outside the legal system.
The Crosson Report predicted that “ [principled disagreements over the concept of cameras in courts will always be with us.” (Id. at 171.) Nevertheless, the report concluded that “the experience of a large majority of those who actually participated in the experiment leads logically to only one conclusion: cameras do not have a significant adverse effect on judicial proceedings.” (Id.) Analyzing what it saw as “the most significant issues surrounding both the concept of cameras in courts, and the 40-month experiment,” the report found “little evidence” that trial participants “play to the cameras” and suggested that “behavior actually improves.” (Id. at 143.) The report found that jurors were not significantly affected by coverage. Moreover, the report found the concern about jurors watching evening newscasts including coverage of their cases insufficient reason to deny coverage because those cases are indistinguishable from cases where jurors read newspaper accounts of their trial despite being ordered not to by the judge. {Id. at 144.) The report surmised that the concern about discouraging potential witnesses from testifying was not borne out because a relatively small number of witnesses and attorneys surveyed felt this was a problem, and the law provided adequate protection for reluctant witnesses in the form of the opportunity to request exclusion of coverage and the mandated exclusion of coverage in various sensitive cases. {Id. at 145.) The report disagreed with criticism of its self-reporting methodology, arguing that “there always will be an element of subjectivity in any evaluation of cameras in court.” {Id. at 168.) “If the participants’ judgment cannot be relied upon,” the report rhetorically asked, “whose judgment can be?” {Id. at 172.)
In contrast, a 1991 Northeastern College of Criminal Justice study, entitled “Cameras in the Courtroom Make New Yorkers Reluctant to Testify” (Northeastern study), suggested that witness reluctance was a real issue. {See Rosen affidavit exhibit 9.) The study surveyed “500 randomly selected voters throughout New York State by telephone to examine their perceptions and attitudes toward crime, the criminal justice system and other related issues.” {Id. at 1.) Respondents were asked, inter alia, “how likely they would be to testify in court if they were a victim of crime and learned that the trial would be videotaped for broadcast on the evening news.” {Id.) The study found that out of 487 respondents who answered this question, “4 out of 10 potential victims [would be] less willing to testify in a criminal case.” {Id.)
The Crosson Report recommended making Judiciary Law § 218 permanent. {Id. at 173.) The Legislature engaged in substantial debate. The “Senate and Assembly Judiciary Committees held a joint public hearing on April 23, 1991, to gather testimony from the judiciary, New York State Bar Association, New York State Defenders Association, members of the media, and the public to determine whether audio-visual coverage in the courtroom should be extended, amended, made permanent, or allowed to sunset.” {See Issues, supra at 6.)
“Based on the testimony of critics of the experiment, who cited its procedural deficiencies, the Senate proposed a bill that would extend the program for 2 years, add procedural safeguards which protect witnesses from unwanted and unnecessary media coverage, and create stiffer penalties for contempt for members of the news media who violate such provisions.” {Id.) The Assembly passed a similar measure, but a key difference caused a stalemate. The Senate bill included a provision which would prohibit audiovisual coverage of a nonparty witness without consent of the witness. The Assembly bill contained no such provision. Ultimately, neither side prevailed, and Judiciary Law § 218 sunset on May 31, 1991. (Id. at 6-7.)
The Third Experiment
Thirteen months later, a “critical compromise made by the Senate and the Assembly” enabled the Legislature to reenact Judiciary Law § 218, authorizing a third experiment. (See Issues, supra at 8.) The compromise was reached by including a provision requiring counsel to each party in a criminal proceeding to “advise each nonparty witness that he or she has the right to request that his or her image be visually obscured during said witness’ testimony, and upon such request the presiding trial judge shall order the news media to visually obscure the visual image of the witness in any and all audio-visual coverage of the judicial proceeding.” (See L 1992, ch 187, § 1, adding Judiciary Law § 218 [5] [c].)
The 1992 law also “added measures designed to balance the interests and the rights of the news media, judiciary, witnesses, jurors, and the parties to court proceedings and their counsel.” (See Issues, supra at 7.) For example, the third experimental law prohibited audiovisual coverage of family members of a victim or a party in a criminal case, except during that family member’s testimony; authorized audio coverage of a jury foreperson delivering the verdict (upon consent of the foreperson and subject to the trial judge’s discretion); imposed criminal contempt penalties for members of the media who willfully disobey a court order; and created a third review committee (Roberts Committee). The latter was required to “consist of twelve members, three to be appointed by the governor, three to be appointed by the chief administrator of the courts, two to be appointed by the majority leader of the senate, two to be appointed by the speaker of the assembly, one to be appointed by the minority leader of the senate and one to be appointed by minority leader of the assembly.” (L 1992, ch 187, § 1, adding Judiciary Law § 218 [9] [a].)
In preparing its report, the Roberts Committee (1) solicited and reviewed comments of trial judges who had taken part in audiovisual coverage during the third experiment; (2) solicited complaints, statutory violations and other concerns relating to audiovisual coverage of court proceedings from members of the Criminal Justice Section of the New York State Bar Association and from the New York State District Attorneys Association; (3) collected all applications for audiovisual coverage made during the course of the experiment, and analyzed data from such applications; (4) reviewed and analyzed prior studies and surveys relating to audiovisual coverage in New York and in other jurisdictions; (5) reviewed and analyzed information regarding audiovisual coverage statutes and rules from other jurisdictions; (6) conducted public hearings and reviewed written submissions; and (7) deliberated in private sessions.
Public hearings were held, and the same overarching trends observed in previous public hearings were again reflected. Press representatives lined up in support of permanent audiovisual coverage. District attorneys were largely supportive, while public defenders and some criminal defense attorneys voiced opposition. The primary argument advanced by camera proponents continued to be the lack of evidence of adverse effects. Meanwhile, opponents argued that “adequate research [had] not been conducted to ascertain the effect of televised trials on the public or to determine whether society as a whole benefitted from the coverage.” (See Roberts Report at 53.) Notably, the Legal Aid Society endorsed the legislation, with the safeguards instituted during the third experiment. On the other hand, the ACLU, which had previously given “qualified support for the cameras in the courts program,” opposed the program “unless the defendant is accorded the right to consent to any coverage. The [ACLU’s] change in position was based on the concerns of some that cameras interfere with [defendant’s] right to a fair trial and concerns by others that no reliable evaluation data is available.” (Id. at 67.)
One novel development at the public hearings on the third experiment was the contribution of scholars who had looked closely at the issue. Paul Thaler, Director of Journalism and Media at Mercy College, opposed cameras in the courts because, in his opinion, “television creates an entirely new courtroom environment that can undermine the presumption of innocence and transform criminal defendants into public figures.” Thaler further opined that “[t]he courtroom must be a place where the process of law is carried out without being influenced by social pressures brought to bear on a particular case.” (Roberts Report at 49-50.) Dr. Roberta Entner, an instructor of communications at Rutgers University, who based her doctoral dissertation on cameras in the courts, argued that visual pictures are “creative reflectors, not reportorial mirrors of reality.” {Id. at 70.) After studying videotapes of over 50 New York cases subject to audiovisual coverage, she concluded that “the broadcast media’s need to create exciting, impressive visuals can prejudice criminal defendants, citing as an example a shot of weeping spectators immediately followed by a shot of the defendant.” {Id.)
After reviewing the record, the Roberts Committee concluded that “audio visual coverage has no adverse impact on the vast majority of participants, including, most importantly, witnesses and jurors ... In addition to facilitating greater understanding of legal principles and process, cameras in the courts afford the public the opportunity to confront the major substantive issues that court proceedings often present.” (Roberts Report at 86-87.) Analyzing the primary concerns raised by opponents to audiovisual coverage, the report found no evidence that trial participants, including judges, attorneys, witnesses and jurors, were adversely affected. The report found that fair trial arguments about the prejudicial nature of news broadcasting of trials (i.e., “sound bites” or other prejudicial editing or reporting techniques) were no less prevalent in traditional reporting and provide no reason to bar cameras from courts. {Id. at 92-98.) In sum, the report concluded that “the benefits of the program [were] substantial, with little or no adverse effect on anyone,” declared New York’s experiment with cameras in the courts a success, and recommended that Judiciary Law § 218 be made permanent. {Id. at 104.)
Minority Report
In December 1994, a Minority Report was filed (MR). Its author, Jack T. Litman, urged the Legislature “not to give permanency to the current statute permitting the coerced televising of trials in New York State.” (MR at 1 [emphasis in original].) Litman challenged the Roberts Committee’s objectivity, criticized its methodology and disagreed with its conclusions. He stressed that “[o]f the twelve members of the Committee, eight were closely associated with the media, and two others had publicly expressed their firm pro-camera position long before formation of the Roberts Committee.” (Id.)
Litman questioned the value of the data obtained in the first experiment because it was obtained “by use of a self-report questionnaire” and because jurors and defendants were not questioned. (MR at 9.) Litman noted that, “[according to social scientists, self-reporting questionnaires are highly unreliable and discredited as sociological research.” (Id.) Litman also complained that
“[b]ecause the distribution of the surveys was not tracked, it is impossible to determine whether the data collected was obtained from a representative sample of individuals who had experience with cameras in the courts. No information was available as to the number of witnesses who were exposed to cameras in the courtroom, nor on the total number of surveys distributed to witnesses . . . Only 25% of attorneys involved in audio-visual coverage responded to the questionnaire. OCA did not comment on how many of the lawyers were prosecutors or defense attorneys because the questionnaire fails to elicit this vital question.” (Id. at 9-10.)
Litman argued that, though the advisory committee established for the second experiment proposed a more appropriate methodology, it was “rejected by OCA,” and therefore, “[t]he appropriate methodology design called for by the 1989 legislation was never developed. Tapes were not voluntarily submitted, nor were they studied.” (MR at 15.) In contrast, Litman noted that the Federal Judicial Center did a “content analysis” of videotapes in its 1994 analysis of televised federal civil proceedings, resulting in a decision not to allow further audiovisual coverage. (Id.) Similarly, Litman referred to a May 17, 1991 memorandum to the Senate and Assembly from Professor Bowers, the author of the Northeastern study, which “outlin[ed] the proper research methodology necessary to study and evaluate cameras in the courtroom.” {Id. at 19.) In accordance with the Bowers memorandum, Litman had suggested that the Committee use either a scientifically controlled field experiment or a “matched control group study to be conducted by a qualified research organization which is independent of OCA,” but both requests, as well as his request for a “content analysis,” were “summarily rejected” by the Committee. {Id. at 25.)
Even assuming the validity of the data collected, Litman found reason to question the conclusions of the first two experiments. For example, “thirty-seven percent of attorneys reported that the atmosphere in the courtroom was tense and 35% stated that the atmosphere was uneasy as a result of audio-visual coverage.” (MR at 16.) “Thirty-eight percent of attorney respondents stated that the testimony of witnesses was affected by audio-visual coverage . . . Five percent of the attorneys who had one or more of their witnesses receive audio-visual coverage stated that one or more of their witnesses refused to and did not testify because of audio-visual coverage . . . Forty-four percent of attorneys stated that audio-visual coverage of trials affects fairness negatively.” {Id. at 16-17.) Litman cited the statement of the Criminal Justice Section of the New York State Bar Association that “no potential witness for either side should be lost, or rendered more nervous or distracted or more fearful because of the supposed educational (or entertainment) value of televising their testimony.” {Id. at 43 [emphasis in original].)
Litman also questioned the evidence the Committee used to support its finding of educational value. The Committee relied on a nationwide survey of 1,207 adults conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the people and the press. (MR at 29.) This survey, Litman argued, was of dubious value because it called for respondents’ subjective views as to whether they were better informed as a result of watching televised coverage. {Id.) In contrast, Litman offered the doctoral work of Dr. William Petkanas (Ph.D. Dissertation, NY Univ 1990). Dr. Petkanas questioned New York respondents before and after the first experiment regarding “their knowledge of basic principles that applied in our judicial system.” {Id. at 30.) Litman observed that Petkanas’ analysis “showed no additional understanding of the court system found in those respondents tested a year after the camera experiment began in New York.” (Id.)
In sum, the Minority Report recommended that audiovisual coverage be allowed in criminal cases only with the consent of the defendant. The Minority Report found that the studies done on the first three experiments were not “objective” and that even using the faulty data yielded by those studies, the record compelled “a conclusion diametrically opposed to the conclusion reached by the Committee.” (Id. at 68.) In reply, the Roberts Committee argued principally that (1) the objective study recommended by the Bowers proposal would have been too costly in the absence of any appropriation by the Legislature; (2) a “content analysis” was not warranted “[b]ecause the Committee rejects Mr. Litman’s position that the public does not benefit from camera coverage of criminal trials involving violent crime and that limited coverage of court proceedings is harmful”; and (3) the Committee’s objectivity was not impaired by the affiliations of its members. (Roberts Committee Reply to Minority Report at 3-8.)
The Fourth Experiment
On January 31, 1995, the day the “third experiment” was due to sunset, Governor George E. Pataki signed a bill that extended audiovisual coverage of courtroom proceedings until June 30, 1997. “Because the major procedural concerns were hashed over in the previous law . . . this re-enactment was achieved with virtually no fuss.” (Issues, supra at 9.) The Senate stated that as a result of better technology and an increase in “gavel to gavel” coverage, “New Yorkers have a better understanding of legal principles and the court process.” (See Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 8, at 6.) However, the Senate found that “the extent of compliance with the statute by trial judges and the effect of audio-visual coverage on their conduct has not been addressed. In order to discourage violations of the statute in the future, this bill continues the experiment without giving it permanence.” (Id.)
The 1995 bill mandated the creation of a fourth advisory committee. Addressing the objectivity concerns raised by the Minority Report in the third experiment, the Legislature limited the number of media representatives allowed on the committee to two, prohibited membership by any members of previous review committees, and required that at least one member be “a professional research analyst qualified to evaluate and analyze the impact and effect of audio-visual coverage of judicial proceedings.” (See Issues at 9.) The committee was asked to review the efficacy of the experiment by assessing (1) whether a public benefit accrued; (2) whether any abuses occurred; (3) whether, and to what extent, the “conduct of participants in court proceedings changes when audio-visual coverage is present”; (4) the degree of statutory compliance by judges and the media; and (5) the “effect of audio-visual coverage on the conduct of trial judges both inside and outside the courtroom.” (See Feerick Report at 27.)
Several groups submitted memoranda opposing the legislation. The Criminal Justice Section of the New York State Bar Association, citing the Minority Report in the third experiment, endorsed Judiciary Law § 218 only if “there shall be no coverage of a trial if counsel for a party objects.” (See Bill Jacket, L 1995, ch 8, at 13.) The Women’s Bar Association of the State of New York also voiced its demand that any law authorizing audiovisual coverage require the consent of the defendant in a criminal case, and include additional safeguards for children in actions affecting them (e.g., matrimonial actions) and for victims of “crimes involving domestic violence of a non-sexual nature.” (Id. at 17-18.) The New York State Defenders Association took the position that the Legislature should “disapprove any bill which would allow further experimentation with cameras in the criminal courts. Instead, it should reaffirm the 43 year-old presumption against cameras in the courts . . . .” (Id. at 28.) Meanwhile, the 1995 Bill Jacket for chapter 8 is replete with articles from editorial pages of New York newspapers in support of making audiovisual coverage of trial court proceedings permanent.
The Feerick Committee’s Methodology
The Feerick Committee adopted a more thorough methodology than any of its predecessors. In preparing its report, the Feerick Committee (1) designed and conducted a written survey to assess the experience of New York judges with cameras in the courtroom; (2) contacted the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, “which agreed to survey public opinion in New York on the issue of cameras in the courtroom”; (3) “wrote to the presidents and executive directors of 150 bar associations in New York asking for information about the experience of their members”; (4) “contacted the New York Law Journal, which agreed, as a public service, to run a prominent notice of the Committee’s interest in receiving public comments”; (5) held public hearings, each announced by press release; (6) sought OCA data regarding media applications for audiovisual coverage; (7) “invited television stations around the state to provide samples of their televised courtroom footage”; (8) gathered relevant information on the policies of other states and federal courts and reviewed United States Supreme Court precedent as well as “legal and psycho-social literature in this field”; (9) sought information from “the deans of all of the law schools in New York State” regarding educational use of televised trials; (10) solicited information from “eleven jury consultants . . . about their experience with the impact of cameras in the courtroom on jurors and other trial participants”; and (11) conferred informally with media scholars, as well as “camera-experienced” attorneys and judges in New York and from other jurisdictions, including other states, and federal courts.
The Record Developed by the Feerick Committee
The Feerick Report summarized its evidentiary findings as follows.
A. “Public Benefits”
1. “Public Education About the Courts”
Proponents testified that audiovisual coverage can “demystify the judicial system and allow the public to become better informed about courtroom procedures.” (Feerick Report at 27 [citing testimony of John Corporon, former news director of WPIX-TV].) “Not only do cameras educate the public about the courts in general, say camera proponents, but they shed light on major societal problems.” {Id. at 28 [citing testimony of Judge Harold Rothwax, who presided over the Joel Steinberg trial, that “cameras opened ‘a window into the whole area of child abuse’ ”]; see also testimony of Jeanne Mullgrav, director of court programs at the Victims Services Agency [“cameras in the courtroom educate the public about domestic violence and other problems formerly ‘swept under the rug’ . . .”], id. at 29.) The survey of New York law school deans revealed that among the five schools which regularly used videotapes of court proceedings, “tapes of New York State Court of Appeals arguments appear to have received the widest use.” (Id.)
2. “Judicial Accountability and Public Scrutiny of the Judicial System”
The Committee noted that 63% of the approximately 350 New York State judges who responded to its judicial survey agreed that “television coverage fosters public scrutiny of judicial proceedings,” and 25% “agreed that television coverage had a positive effect on the state’s criminal justice system.” Of the 616 New York State registered voters surveyed by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion (Marist Poll), 20% agreed that “cameras in the courtroom had a positive effect on New York’s justice system.” (Feerick Report at 30.)
3. “Cathartic and Deterrent Effects”
The Committee cited testimony that “sentencings in criminal cases have become an important feature of television coverage of court proceedings.” (Feerick Report at 32.) “According to some Committee witnesses, coverage of sentencing lets the public know that the personal tragedies caused by the defendant are taken into account.” (Id. at 33 [citing testimony of Bud Carey, general manager, WCBS-TV].) In addition to those “cathartic effects,” the Committee cited testimony to the effect that “ ‘televised trials have the potential power to deter viewers from criminal or wrongful acts.’ ” (Id. [citing letter dated Dec. 20, 1996 from Joseph Kelner, Esq. to the Committee].) For example, the Committee cited Steven Brill’s testimony stating that “ ‘one of the bedrock purposes of the criminal justice system . . . is . . . the embarrassment of the guilty. That is part of what deterrence is all about.’ ” (Id.)
4. “Other Benefits”
The Committee cited testimony that “camera coverage has prompted witnesses to come forward who did not realize the potential significance of their testimony until they saw a case on television.” (Feerick Report at 33 [citing testimony of Honorable Howard Relin, Monroe County District Attorney].) The Committee also cited testimony suggesting that witnesses are more likely to testify truthfully when cameras are present, and that “cameras allow news to be reported ‘with greater accuracy and insight.’ ” (Id. at 34 [citing testimony of Bud Carey, general manager, WCBS-TV].) The Committee acknowledged, however, that judges surveyed were “evenly divided on the question of whether cameras in the courtroom increase the accuracy of press coverage of judicial proceedings.” (Id.) According to the Committee’s survey, only 23% of judges surveyed agreed that televised nightly news coverage accurately represents what actually takes place in New York courtrooms, while 63% agreed that “televised gavel-to-gavel coverage of court proceedings accurately represents what takes place in court.” (Id. [emphasis in original].) According to the Marist Poll, only 28% of the public “agreed that cameras in the courtroom increase the accuracy of news coverage.” (Id. at 35.)
5. “Opponents’ Views”
“Contrasting with the testimony and public comments the Committee received about the public benefits of cameras in the courtroom were the strong reservations voiced by some judges and members of the public about the educational benefits of cameras in the courtroom.” (Feerick Report at 35.) While 45% of judges surveyed agreed that “ ‘television coverage has enhanced public understanding of New York’s judicial system, 52% of the responding judges disagreed with that statement.’ ” (Id.) In addition, 80% of respondents agreed that “television coverage of court proceedings is more likely to serve as a source of entertainment than education for the viewing public.” (Id. at 35 n 149.) Of those surveyed by the Marist Poll, 61% “thought that cameras in the courtroom are a ‘bad idea.’ ” (Id.)
The Committee analyzed specific opposing viewpoints as to (a) “the nature of televised coverage”; (b) “the effect on witnesses”; (c) “fair trial implications”; and (d) “privacy concerns.”
a. “Nature of Televised Coverage”
The Committee found that “the vast preponderance of cases which received audio-visual coverage were criminal, often involving a homicide or other crime ‘at the high end of the sentencing structure.’ ” (Id. at 36 [citing testimony of Terence Kindlon, Esq.].) The Committee noted reaction to this fact, in the form of testimony that coverage focused on “sensational cases,” conveying a “very false sense impression of what justice is all about and what courtroom procedures are all about.” (Id. [citing letter dated Nov. 1, 1996 from Philip Learned, Chemung Bar Association].) In addition, the Committee cited testimony questioning the accuracy of televised proceedings from the point of view of the television audience. For example, George Gerbner, former Dean of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, stated that television creates the deceptive “illusion of actually seeing [a trial] [sic] when, in fact, what you are seeing are camera angles, camera selections, editing, etc.” (Id. at 37.)
b. “Effect on Witnesses”
The Committee mentioned testimony from “spokespersons for crime victims who expressed the opinion that there is a ‘significant risk’ that cameras will have a chilling effect on a victim or witness’ willingness to report a crime or testify in court.” (Id. at 38.) The Committee noted that “Hon. Howard Relin, Monroe County District Attorney, although strongly supportive of cameras in the courtroom, testified that he had observed in court proceedings a ‘very disturbing trend’ of witness intimidation, in the form of threats of witness’ physical safety, over the past several years,” resulting in some witnesses’ reluctance to “have their face and voice disseminated on television.” (Id. at 39.)
c. “Fair Trial Implications”
The Committee acknowledged that strong fair trial concerns were evident in the results of the Marist Poll. The Committee noted that 62% of respondents thought that “television cameras in the courtroom get in the way of a fair trial, while 29% [thought] that television coverage decreases the possibility that courts will be unjust.” (Id. at 39.) Furthermore, “70% of respondents would not want their trial televised if they were a party to a civil lawsuit. 68% would not want the trial televised if they were the victim of a crime; and 69% would not want their trial televised if they were a criminal defendant.” (Id. at 40.)
Additionally, the Committee observed that “[c]oncerns about the fair trial implications of cameras in the courtroom lay at the heart of much of the opposition to cameras voiced by a number of judges and criminal defense attorneys . . . .” (Id.) In this connection, the Committee mentioned the testimony of Presiding Justice Francis T. Murphy of the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, who referred to “the absence of proof that the defendant will not be prejudiced by cameras in the courtroom and testified that the burden of proof should be on camera proponents to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant will get a fair trial if cameras are present.” (Id.) The Committee also cited the testimony of Jack Litman, who asked, “[h]ow is the defendant to prove that the prosecutor acted differently than he ordinarily would have, [or] that defense counsel was more concerned with impressing prospective clients than with the interests of the defendant . . . ?” (Id.)
d. “Privacy Concerns”
The Committee noted privacy concerns raised in the context of protecting children in matrimonial proceedings. (Id. at 42 [citing testimony of Eleanor Alter, Esq.].) Also mentioned in this context was the testimony of Frank Bensel, defense counsel in the Libby Zion case, who “questioned the wisdom of forcing private litigants in a civil case to air their dispute on commercial television, where coverage of the three-month long trial competed with the afternoon soap operas.” (Id.)
B. “Compliance by Trial Judges and the Media”
The Committee found little reason to be concerned that trial judges did not perform their functions competently. Testimony and public comment generally supported the view that judges satisfactorily complied with the requirements of the statute. The judicial survey revealed that judges exercised discretion under the law while employing reasonable procedures for determining whether, and to what extent to grant permission for audiovisual coverage. (Id. at 44-45.) The OCA data showed that the approval rate for applications for audiovisual coverage during the trial period was 83.5% with the most common conditions imposed (in order of frequency) being restrictions on the news media’s equipment, restrictions on photographing the defendant’s face, and restrictions on revealing the defendant’s name, the victim’s name and/or face, and a prohibition on filming spectators. (Id. at 47.) The Committee’s record also contained “strong evidence of compliance by many television reporters and camera persons with the requirements and safeguards of Section 218 of the Judiciary Law.” (Id.)
C. “Effect of Audio-Visual Coverage on the Conduct of Participants in Court Proceedings”
The Committee recognized that
“[a]t the core of the debate over the wisdom of allowing cameras in the courtroom is the question of whether cameras have an impact on trial participants — the jurors, the witnesses, the lawyers or the judge — and, ultimately, on the outcome of the case. In an earlier era, the concern included a fear that the camera itself — unwieldy, noisy, and accompanied by glaring lights — might distract the trial participants from the tasks at hand. However, with the advances in technology, those fears have been laid to rest.
“What remain very much alive are the concerns about the psychological impact of the camera: how will the realization that their every word and gesture is being transmitted to a vast, unseen audience affect the behavior of trial participants?” (Feerick Report at 51.)
In analyzing these important “concerns about the psychological impact of the camera,” the Committee focused on the camera’s effect on jurors, witnesses, lawyers and judges.
1. “Effect on Jurors”
The Committee found that the two primary concerns voiced at the public hearings with respect to jurors were the potentially adverse effect of jurors watching televised coverage on the case in which they were serving, and the effect of “their realization that the eyes of the general public are upon them and will be reluctant to reach a verdict which is ‘unpopular’ with the community to which they will return after the trial.” (Id. at 53.) The Committee also cited testimony of jurors in the Libby Zion malpractice action against New York Hospital. Janet Dubin, jury foreperson in that case, testified that “after the trial was over, she watched televised videotapes of the trial, which she felt was ‘so different’ from being on trial.” (Id.) Her fellow juror, Edgar Green, expressed his opinion that cameras in the courtroom are “generally not helpful.” (Id.) A third juror in the Zion case, Diane De Beilis, wrote to the Committee about her “strong feelings in favor of and against the videotaping and airing of trials.” (Id.) While she felt the practice yielded educational benefits and provided incentives for more truthful witness’ testimony as well as more competent lawyering, she also found the cameras “ ‘invasive and disruptive,’ especially for those who ‘experience a sense of discomfort when in front of a camera.’ ” (Id. at 53.)
The Committee described the comments of the three “jury consultants” interviewed on behalf of the Committee:
“One was of the opinion that the presence of cameras would exaggerate the importance of the case for jurors and that, in most cases, camera coverage would be harmful to criminal defendants, in part because some defense witnesses may be less forthcoming if cameras are present. A second jury consultant felt that there was very little impact so long as there was only one camera focused on the witness box ... A third jury consultant was concerned about televised coverage that might mislead members of the public who constitute the pool of prospective jurors.” (Feerick Report at 54.)
2. “Effect on Witnesses”
The Committee noted that testimony as to the effect of audiovisual coverage on witnesses was received on both sides of the issue. The Marist Poll results showed that the public’s willingness to testify was strongly correlated to the presence of cameras. “54% of all respondents, 45% of black respondents, 41% of regular TV-trial watchers and 64% of women said they would be less willing to testify as a witness to a crime if cameras were present. In contrast, only 20% of all respondents, 16% of black respondents, 20% of regular TV-trial watchers and 23% of women said they would not be willing to testify if only newspaper reporters were present.” (Id. at 57.) The Committee acknowledged that some criminal defense lawyers testified that cameras in the courtroom affect the willingness of some defense witnesses to come forward in criminal cases. (Id.) The Committee also cited comments by Jack Litman that some defense witnesses would not appear even when told about their right to be obscured by the “blue dot,” and that the “deterrent and intimidating effects of cameras fall disproportionately on defense witnesses, who are typically friends and neighbors of the defendant and are less used to the criminal justice system . . . than forensic experts or police officers who routinely appear in courtrooms on the prosecution’s behalf.” (Id.)
Part II of the Committee’s judicial survey was completed only by judges who had received an application for television coverage in their courtrooms. Of these judges, 40% agreed that “witnesses were more nervous in the presence of cameras.” (Id. at 59.) Moreover, the Committee found that 32% “thought witnesses were distracted by the presence of TV cameras”; 22% “thought witnesses’ testimony was more guarded in the presence of cameras”; 3% “thought witnesses were more truthful in the presence of cameras”; and 32% “thought witnesses’ privacy was violated by the presence of cameras.” (Id.)
3. “Effect on Lawyers”
The Committee summarized the testimony of attorneys on this subject as follows.
“The experience of lawyers who had tried camera-covered cases ran the gamut from one lawyer who wrote to the Committee to say that the presence of cameras made everyone ‘extremely self-conscious,’ to another who testified that it never even occurred to him that the camera was there during a highly sensational murder trial. In between was one lawyer who testified that some lawyers are more conscious of the cameras than he would like them to be and another who expressed his view that ‘there are a number of my colleagues who believe that television in the courtroom represents essentially free advertising and I think that many times that affects the way they present the case.’ ” (Feerick Report at 60.)
Meanwhile, 35% of the judges responding to Part II of the Committee’s judicial survey agreed that “lawyers came to court better prepared in cases in which TV cameras were present,” while 33% thought that “more arguments were made in camera-covered cases,” and 26% felt that “more objections were made in camera-covered cases.” (Id. at 61.)
4. “Effect on Judges”
The Committee emphasized that “[w]ith near unanimity, witnesses and interested citizens agreed that the presence of cameras had some effect on judges. There was disagreement over whether the effect was beneficial or harmful.” (Id. at 62.) Effects cited included a “watchdog impact” ensuring that judges “carefully consider motions and rulings which they might otherwise treat in a more pro forma fashion,” and the fear that “the desire for publicity may adversely affect a judge’s rulings or his or her conduct at sentencing.” (Id. at 63 [citing testimony of attorneys Luke Pittoni and Peter Moschetti].) While 52% of judges responding to the judicial survey disagreed with the proposition that cameras in the courts “tend to cause judges to issue rulings they might otherwise not issue,” 37% “agreed with that statement.” (Id. at 64.)
The Feerick Committee’s Assessment and Conclusions
Satisfied that it had “heard a broad spectrum of points of view from a wide range of persons with experience and expertise,” the Committee concluded that the foremost benefit of audiovisual coverage was “enhanced public scrutiny of the judicial system.” (Feerick Report at 66.) The Committee commented, however, that the record before it did not “establish to what extent the presence of cameras in New York State courts has actually enhanced the public’s understanding of New York’s judicial system.” (Id.) The Committee noted that judges were split on this question, and found that the vast majority of coverage was in the form of brief segments on the evening news about criminal cases involving violent crimes “which is by itself hardly sufficient to promote a detailed understanding of the judicial system.” (Id. at 67.) Regardless, the Committee had “little doubt that television coverage has drawn the public’s attention to major societal problems, such as domestic violence and child abuse, and has served a cathartic purpose for the families of some homicide victims.” (Id.) The Committee referred to testimony that “the presence of cameras may operate as a disincentive for some victims of sex crimes, domestic violence or child abuse either to report such crimes or to participate as witnesses in judicial proceedings involving those crimes.” (Id.)
The Committee acknowledged the Marist Poll results, which had found that “a majority of the public would not want their trial televised if they were a party to a proceeding or the victim of a crime.” (Id. at 67.) Still, the Committee concluded that while “[w]eighing the question of public benefits is not a simple matter,” the “benefits that flow from televised coverage of the judicial process are so important that they ought not to be sacrificed by barring cameras from the courtroom across-the-board.” (Id.) Significantly, the Committee noted that in making this determination, it was guided by the precept that “ ‘what happens in a trial is a public matter’ ” and should be accessible to as many interested New Yorkers as possible. (Id. [citing testimony of Syracuse University Professor Jay Wright, executive director, New York State Fair Trial/Free Press Conference].) Consequently, the Committee struck the balance in favor of coverage, observing that “[v]ideo and photographs have become important tools in presenting news to the public, many of whom now rely on television as their principal source of information about public affairs.” (Id.)
Despite its conclusions, the Committee recognized that central to the “debate over cameras in the courtroom are concerns about the psychological impact of the camera.” (Id. at 70.) The Committee observed that “[t]he U.S. Judicial Conference brought its ‘cameras in the court’ pilot project to a halt because the ‘intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors was cause for concern.’ ” (Id. at 71 [citing memorandum dated Sept. 22, 1995 from L. Ralph Mecham, director, Administrative Office of the United States Courts to All Judges, United States Courts].) The Committee noted that “[p]rior Committees, reviewing earlier surveys of judges, lawyers and other trial participants, concluded that evidence of impact on trial participants was too slight to outweigh the benefits of cameras.” (Id.) In addition, the Committee found support for its conclusions in the fact that “[t]he majority of states which permit camera coverage of court proceedings have reached similar conclusions.” (Id.) Weighing all the foregoing, the Committee decided that its record “[did] not show that the fears regarding the impact of cameras on trial participants have been realized in New York during the experimental period,” and, therefore, concluded that “any impact cameras may have on trial participants does not justify an across-the-board ban of cameras in courtrooms.” (Id.)
The Committee recommended that the fourth experimental law be made permanent; that “defendant consent should be a prerequisite for camera coverage of bail hearings”; that “there should be no separate rule for death penalty cases”; that “judges should be vigilant in addressing the safety and privacy concerns of witnesses in both criminal and civil proceedings”; that “[OCA] should actively monitor camera-covered proceedings, make periodic reports, and, if necessary, recommend changes in Section 218 of the Judiciary Law and the implementing rule”; and that “[OCA] should develop an enhanced judicial training program to familiarize all judges with the applicable statutory and administrative provisions and safeguards.” (Id. at 77-81.)
Minority Report
A Minority Report (MR2) dated April 1, 1997 was delivered by Committee member Leonard E. Noisette. Mr. Noisette recommended that the “Judiciary Law Section 218 experiment be ended and that the statute be allowed to expire on June 30, 1997, so that, as was true from 1952 to 1987, there shall be no audiovisual coverage of New York State court proceedings.” (MR2 at 1.) Commending the Committee for developing a “record which will be helpful to the Legislature when it again considers how to deal with the matter of television cameras in our courts,” Noisette argued that “after ten years and four experimental periods, camera proponents are still unable to provide any study or empirical evidence that television coverage of court proceedings has met the statutory goals of the experiment. To the contrary, the Committee’s most important contributions— its survey of the judiciary of this state, and its New York voters survey — indicate that the experiment has been a failure in this regard.” (Id. at 2.) Further, Noisette argued that the Committee erred in presuming that “the burden is on those opposed to cameras in our courts to prove the harm they cause, instead of recognizing that camera proponents should be required to demonstrate the benefits that accrue for allowing such access.” (Id.)
Noisette questioned the Committee’s finding of a public education benefit, arguing that “meaningful public education is an aspirational goal at best.” (Id. at 3.) Noisette cited the record evidence that most coverage reached the public in the form of nightly news “snippets, which shed little light on the complexity of court proceedings.” (Id.) He also cited the responses of law school deans indicating that “other than public television coverage of Court of Appeals arguments and the rare extensive, coverage of trial proceedings, there was little educational value to . . . television coverage.” (Id.) Noisette pointed to the testimony of scholars suggesting that while television coverage may have contributed to “enhanced television audiences,” there is “no evidence whatsoever” that the coverage led to enhanced public education. (Id. [citing testimony of Richard D. Heffner].)
Conceding that “openness” and “public access” are “fundamental aspects of our democratic society,” Noisette stated that the Committee’s finding of a “public scrutiny” benefit to audiovisual coverage was “unsupported by the record” because it presumed a “degree of coverage of judicial conduct that does not in fact exist.” (Id. at 6.) Noisette emphasized that “the Committee’s openness and access conclusions fail[ed] to deal with the nature of television and the difference between the experience of actually being in a courtroom and that of viewing selective and filtered TV tube images.” (Id.)
Noisette attacked the Committee’s conclusions with regard to the effect of audiovisual coverage on trial participants. Noisette argued that the Committee was unjustified in dismissing the concerns expressed by “a range of witnesses regarding the deterrent effect on witnesses,” the conclusion of the Judicial Conference of the United States that “any negative impact on witnesses or jurors could be a threat to the fair administration of justice,” the Marist Poll results “which indicated that the majority of voters would not want trials to be televised if they were criminal defendants, civil parties, witnesses or victims,” and the results of the Committee’s own judicial survey indicating that 37% of responding judges agreed that “the presence of television cameras in the courtroom tends to cause judges to issue rulings they otherwise might not issue.” (Id. at 4.) In light of this evidence of “an adverse impact on trial participants and the conducting of a fair trial,” Noisette argued that the Committee’s recommendation was “not consistent with the voluminous record before it.” (Id.)
The Sunset of Judiciary Law § 218
Judiciary Law § 218 expired on June 30, 1997, when the Legislature “failed to act” to extend it or make it permanent. (Complaint II 91.) An effort to revive Judiciary Law § 218 was immediately sponsored by Senate Republican James J. Lack, but the bill “died” on the Senate floor on July 16, 1996. (See Spencer, Effort on Cameras in Courts Dies, NYLJ, July 16, 1997, at 1, col 4.) While some have called the sunset of Judiciary Law § 218 in 1997 an example of “politically created procrastination or inaction,” others see the Legislature’s inaction as a legitimate response to the important public policy issues raised during the 10-year experiment, including the broadcasting during the 1990s of many “high profile trials.” (See Balter and Simone, Diallo Case Not the Last Word on Cameras in Court, NYLJ, Mar. 16, 2000, at 1, col 1.)
Overview of Federal and State Jurisdictions
Adopted in 1946, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure former rule 53 provides that “[t]he taking of photographs in the court room during the progress of judicial proceedings or radio broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the court room shall not be permitted by the court.” (Fed Rules Grim Pro former rule 53.) Rule 53 has been interpreted to proscribe television broadcasting of criminal trials as well. (See, e.g., United States v Moussaoui, 205 FRD 183 [ED Va 2002], citing United States v Hastings, 695 F2d 1278, 1280 [11th Cir 1983].)
“In 1972, the Judicial Conference of the United States adopted a prohibition against ‘broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto ....’” (FJC Report at 3.) “In September 1990, the Judicial Conference . . . authorized a three-year pilot program allowing electronic media coverage of civil proceedings in selected federal trial and appellate courts . . . .” (Id. at 4.) In 1994, after analyzing the results of the pilot program, the FJC Report recommended that “the Judicial Conference authorize federal courts of appeals and district courts nationwide to provide camera access to civil proceedings . . . .” (Id. at 43.) “By a 2-1 majority, the Judicial Conference concluded that ‘the intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors was cause for serious concern,’ ” and rejected the recommendations of the FJC Report. (See Feerick Report at 24-25.)
After the FJC rejected the recommendation of its report, several United States District Courts granted media applications for audiovisual coverage of civil proceedings on the basis that the Judicial Conference policy did not supercede local district court rules permitting coverage. (See, e.g., Marisol v Giuliani, 929 F Supp 660 [SD NY 1996]; Katzman v Victoria’s Secret Catalogue, 923 F Supp 580 [SD NY 1996].) The Judicial Conference “urged each circuit to abrogate any local rules of court that conflicted with the prohibition on cameras in the trial courts.” (See Feerick Report at 25-26.) Consequently, most United States District Courts currently prohibit audiovisual coverage of civil trials, although some local district rules allow it.
As for the state courts, it is difficult to make a definitive statement at any given point in time as to what is essentially a national patchwork quilt of policies. Still, it is undisputed that today, a substantial majority of states permit audiovisual coverage of trial court proceedings.
Conclusions of Law
Federal Constitutional Claims
In Richmond v Virginia (448 US 555 [1980]), the Court held that “everyone” has a right to “attend criminal trials to hear, see, and communicate observations concerning them.” (See id. at 576.) Consequently, the Court found that a closure of the courtroom to the public is constitutionally permitted only if it is justified by “an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.” (See Press-Enterprise I, supra at 510.) Court TV argues that Civil Rights Law § 52 effects an unconstitutional closure of the courtroom by prohibiting audiovisual coverage of trials. The court disagrees.
Standard of Review
Court TV argues that strict scrutiny should apply to section 52 under the analysis developed in the Richmond line of cases. However, the right to televise court proceedings was not among the rights recognized in Richmond or its progeny. Instead, the Richmond court indicated that restrictions on audiovisual coverage of trials, like ordinances requiring licenses for public parades or zoning laws regulating the location of adult establishments, should be treated as time, place, and manner restrictions subject to rational basis scrutiny. (See Richmond, supra at 581 n 18 [“(i)t is far more important that trials be conducted in a quiet and orderly setting than it is to preserve that atmosphere on city streets”], citing Cox v New Hampshire, 312 US 569 [1941]; Globe, supra at 607 n 17, citing Young v American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 US 50, 63 n 18 [1976].) This result is consistent with Chandler, decided after Richmond, where the Court held that “there is no constitutional right to have [live witness] [sic] testimony recorded and broadcast.” (Id. at 569, quoting Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc., 435 US 589, 610 [1978].) The upshot of Chandler, Estes and the Richmond cases is that audiovisual coverage of court proceedings is neither prohibited nor required under the First Amendment. Thus, it follows that a court may impose reasonable restrictions on audiovisual coverage.
Court TV cites no case, and the court is aware of none, where an appellate court, in any state or federal jurisdiction, has applied strict scrutiny to restrictions on audiovisual coverage of trials. On the contrary, United States Courts of Appeals in the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have upheld rules prohibiting audiovisual coverage of court proceedings as reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on speech. (See Posr v Killackey, 2002 US Dist LEXIS 9604 [SD NY 2002], citing United States v Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 747 F2d 111, 113 [2d Cir 1984] [upholding court rule prohibiting use of recording devices in courtroom as reasonable time, place, and manner restriction]; Combined Communications Corp. v Finesilver, 672 F2d 818, 821 [10th Cir 1982] [“(t)he First Amendment does not guarantee the media a constitutional right to televise inside a courthouse”]; Conway v United States, 852 F2d 187, 188-189 [6th Cir 1988], cert denied 488 US 943 [1988] [court rules prohibiting broadcasting, telecasting or photographing judicial proceedings did not violate press right to be present, speak and publish concerning trials]; United States v Edwards, 785 F2d 1293, 1295 [5th Cir 1986] [right of access granted in Richmond was right to “attend, listen and report”]; United States v Kerley, 753 F2d 617, 620-622 [7th Cir 1985] [rule banning cameras from criminal trials held reasonable time, place and manner restriction on news-gathering activities]; United States v Hastings, 695 F2d 1278, 1280 [11th Cir 1983], cert denied sub nom. Post-Newsweek, Fla., Inc. v United States, 461 US 931 [1983] [right of access recognized in Richmond was “right to attend” criminal trials].)
As Judge Oakes wrote in Westmoreland v Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. (752 F2d 16, 23 [2d Cir 1984]), “[t]here is a long leap . . . between a public right under the First Amendment to attend trials and a public right under the First Amendment to see a given trial televised.” It is a leap the Second Circuit was unwilling to take. Similarly, the only appellate court in this state that has faced the issue since Richmond has held that there is no “right under the US Constitution to televise or otherwise broadcast” trial proceedings. (See Santiago, 273 AD2d supra at 814.) The teaching of these uncontroverted appellate authorities is that a rule barring audiovisual coverage of trial proceedings is a time, place, and manner restriction on speech subject to rational basis scrutiny.
Nevertheless, Court TV advances essentially two arguments for applying strict scrutiny to Civil Rights Law § 52. Neither persuades the court. The first focuses on the Richmond court’s citation to First Natl. Bank of Boston v Bellotti (435 US 765 [1978]), where the Court held that “[the] First Amendment goes beyond protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals to prohibit government from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may draw.” (Id. at 783.) At oral argument, Court TV suggested that “the stock of information certainly includes the actual proceedings of a courtroom . . . .” In papers, Court TV theorizes that Bellotti and Richmond are examples of an “extraordinarily speech-protective law” emerging from the Supreme Court’s decision in New York Times Co. v Sullivan (376 US 254 [1964]). According to Court TV the broad sweep of this jurisprudence implies a right to televise court proceedings.
The argument does not lack creativity, but it goes too far. There are “ ‘few restrictions on action which could not be clothed by ingenious argument in the garb of decreased data flow.’ ” (See Richmond, supra at 588 [Brennan, J., concurring], quotingZemel v Rusk, 381 US 1, 16-17 [1965].) The fact remains that Bellotti was cited in Richmond as support for the First Amendment right to attend and report on trials — not to televise them. Moreover, the Richmond court anticipated attempts, such as Court TV’s here, to expand its holding. Consequently, the Richmond court invoked the time, place, and manner doctrine as the appropriate framework for dealing with restrictions on audiovisual coverage. Indeed, the Richmond court cited Estes as a case where time, place, and manner restrictions on audiovisual coverage would have been appropriate to ensure a fair trial.
Second, Court TV argues that the press deserves special consideration as the public’s “surrogate.” Referring to the Rich mond court’s historical discussion, Court TV contended at oral argument that “originally when you had a trial you’d have everybody from the community there, and as the societies have developed, it’s become less and less possible to do that, to where now only a tiny fraction of people that are interested in a trial, particularly a high profile trial, can get in the courtroom doors.” The implication is that public access means access beyond the physical limitations of the courtroom. This argument, too, is rejected by the Court in Richmond. In the same footnote where the Richmond court analogized restrictions on audiovisual coverage to time, place and manner restrictions, the Court observed that “since courtrooms have limited capacity, there may be occasions when not every person who wishes to attend can be accommodated. In such situations, reasonable restrictions on general access are traditionally imposed, including preferential seating for media representatives.” (See id. at 581 n 18 [citations omitted].) Thus, the Richmond court acknowledged that First Amendment access rights are not necessarily violated when the number of eyeballs that can observe the proceedings is in direct proportion to the number of seats in the courtroom.
In contrast, Court TV’s public surrogate argument implies that First Amendment rights are violated if access is denied to those who would watch the proceedings from their living rooms. The court finds this reading of Richmond and its progeny strained at best. The notion of trials before a mass audience has not been held in high regard by the court. (See, e.g., Chandler,; supra at 580 [“ ‘Yankee Stadium’ ‘show trials’ tell more about the power of the state than about its concern for the decent administration of justice . . .”].)
Rational Basis Analysis
In applying the rational basis test, the test the court finds applicable here, courts must “defer to the Legislature, which is presumed to know all facts that would support a statute’s constitutionality — a presumption which must be rebutted beyond a reasonable doubt. The Legislature’s actual purpose need not be apparent, for a statute is constitutional if rationally related to any conceivable legitimate State purpose.” (People v Walker, 81 NY2d 661 [1993], citing Maresca v Cuomo, 64 NY2d 242 [1984].) Therefore, the burden here is on Court TV to show that there is no conceivable legitimate state purpose for Civil Rights Law § 52. Court TV fails to make this showing.
Court TV argues that technological advances and 10 years of experiments in New York have discredited the Legislature’s reasons for passing Civil Rights Law § 52. There is no dispute that Court TV’s small, silent, remote-controlled camera utilizing only natural light does not present the physical problems of television coverage which beset a bygone era. As Court TV correctly points out, this issue has not been in serious contention for some time. However, the physical disruption caused by audiovisual coverage has never been the sole rationale for section 52. The law was designed to protect the right of a witness compelled to testify to “have a fair opportunity to present his testimony.” (See Public Papers of Governor Dewey at 324 [1952].) This right was thought to be impaired not only by the “batteries of cameras, microphones and glaring lights,” which have since gone the way of hand-cranked film cameras, but also because the televised witness “knows he is being seen or heard by millions of people.” (See id.) The Legislature in 1987 recognized that technological advances alone were not sufficient to dispel all concerns as to whether audiovisual coverage could be allowed while preserving intact the ideal of fairness embodied in Civil Rights Law § 52. For this reason, it made Judiciary Law § 218 experimental, recognizing that “[t]here may be inherent problems in any court proceeding which could possibly be complicated by audio-visual coverage.” (See L 1987, ch 113, § 1.)
More important, the vast record developed during New York’s 10-year experiment contains ample evidence from which the Legislature could rationally conclude that Civil Rights Law § 52 advances the State’s interest in fair trials. As the New York experience developed, and observation of the experiments became successively more objective and comprehensive, concerns about the effect of audiovisual coverage on trial participants persisted and even increased. There was credible testimony that some witnesses had been deterred from testifying by the prospect of being filmed, while others had been negatively affected at trial. There was testimony that audiovisual coverage had meaningfully affected judges’ behavior at a core level — by changing how they issued orders. There was evidence that jurors’ behavior could significantly be altered by cameras. There was the testimony of scholars who, after careful study of the issue, concluded that televised trials present fundamental challenges to fairness by allowing external social pressures to exert influence in the courtroom. And, there was resounding evidence that the public, after years of exposure to televised trials, remained skeptical of their value, were less inclined to testify in front of cameras, and had developed an aversion to having their own trials covered.
The record reveals a Legislature which repeatedly modified Judiciary Law § 218, attempting to permit audiovisual coverage while preserving fairness. Sensible limitations were imposed on coverage, and by all appearances, the media acted responsibly in observing them. Nonetheless, concerns remained that witnesses were unfairly affected. As an attempted compromise, witnesses were given the right to have their image visually obscured (causing Court TV to suspend coverage in cases where witnesses exercised that right). In the end, camera proponents could not marshal enough evidence to satisfy opponents that the benefits of permanently revoking Civil Rights Law § 52 outweighed the risks. The stalemate was evident in 1997, when Assembly Democrats fashioned a bill giving any witness, including non-parties and criminal defendants, the right to shut off the camera during his testimony. The nonstarter legislation revealed the depth and persistence of conviction in the Legislature that audiovisual coverage of trials impacts fairness.
A time, place, and manner restriction on courtroom access is constitutional if it is “reasonable, if it promotes ‘significant governmental interests,’ and if the restriction does not ‘unwarrantedly abridge . . . the opportunities for the communication of thought.’ ” (See Hastings, supra at 1282, citing Richmond, supra; Young, supra.) Court TV argues that even if fair trial concerns may be well founded in some cases, a per se ban on audiovisual coverage cannot be reasonable because experience has shown that trials can be fairly conducted while permitting audiovisual coverage. Court TV misapplies the rational basis standard. The record contains evidence upon which the New York Legislature could reasonably conclude that its legitimate interest in fair trials outweighs the benefits of permitting camera coverage, even on a discretionary basis. As the Federal Judiciary Committee concluded, when weighing the First Amendment benefits of audiovisual coverage against fair trial concerns, any negative impact may be sufficient to tip the scales against coverage. Moreover, Civil Rights Law § 52 does not “unwarrantedly abridge . . . the opportunities for the communication of thought” because reporters are “free to attend the entire trial, and report whatever they observe.” (See Hastings, supra at 1282; see also Sarner, Justice, Take Two: The Continuing Debate Over Cameras In The Courtroom, 10 Seton Hall Const LJ 1053 [2000] [arguing that section 52 withstands rational basis scrutiny].) Thus, section 52 passes muster under the First Amendment.
State Constitutional Claims
It is well settled that “a legislative enactment carries with it an exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality” rebuttable only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the statute’s unconstitutionality. (See Matter of Malpica-Orsini, 36 NY2d 568, 570 [1975], appeal dismissed 423 US 1042 [1976].) In reviewing statutes, courts must presume that “the Legislature has investigated and found facts necessary to support the legislation.” (See id. at 571, citing I.L.F.Y. Co. v Temporary State Hous. Rent Commn., 10 NY2d 263, 269 [1961].) Additionally, “[i]f any state of facts, known or to be assumed, justify the law, the court’s power of inquiry ends.” (Matter of Spielvogel v Ford, 1 NY2d 558, 562 [1956], appeal dismissed 352 US 957 [1957].) Where, as here, a party seeks facial nullification of a statute (as opposed to nullification as applied to a given set of facts), the party is required to show that “ ‘in any degree and in every conceivable application,’ the law suffers wholesale constitutional impairment.” (See Cohen v State of New York, 94 NY2d 1, 8 [1999], quoting McGowan v Burstein, 71 NY2d 729, 733 [1988].) These principles reflect the understanding that “[statutes are quintessentially the product of the democratic lawmaking process.” (See Cohen, supra at 8.) Consequently, courts may not “substitute their judgment for that of the Legislature as to the wisdom and expediency of the legislation.” {Malpica-Orsini, supra at 570.)
Here, the presumption of constitutionality is particularly appropriate, given the serious attention the Legislature paid to Civil Rights Law § 52 during its 10-year experiment with audiovisual coverage. The record amassed in the experiment shows that the Legislature, as it is presumed to have done, thoroughly investigated the question of cameras in New York courts. Four reports were submitted, and a sizable record compiled. Throughout the process, Judiciary Law § 218 was revised to accommodate competing interests. Ultimately, no formulation of the law satisfied a sufficient number of legislators that fair trial concerns would adequately be protected, and section 52 remained in force. As discussed infra, the record developed in the 10-year experiment provides a rational basis for section 52 under the First Amendment.
Nevertheless, Court TV argues that a “right of televised access” is implied by the expansive language of article I, § 8 and by New York’s tradition of heightened protection of speech and the press. Section 52, Court TV contends, runs afoul of this implied right and, therefore, is invalid. The court disagrees.
New York Constitution, Article I, § 8
Article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution provides that “[e]very citizen may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects . . . and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.” Despite the bold language of article I, § 8, it is well settled that “the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech is not an absolute right to be indiscriminately exercised under all circumstances and conditions.” (See People v Feiner, 300 NY 391, 399 [1950].) Nevertheless, article I, § 8 has been held to provide broader speech protection than the First Amendment in some cases, especially those involving freedom of expression. (See People ex rel. Arcara v Cloud Books, 68 NY2d 553 [1986] [section 8 held to invalidate court order closing bookstore after United States Supreme Court held order did not violate First Amendment]; Bellanca v New York State Liq. Auth., 54 NY2d 228 [1981] [provision of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law prohibiting topless dancing in premises licensed to sell liquor unconstitutional under article I, § 8 after United States Supreme Court found same provision constitutional].)
In like manner, the New York Constitution has been construed to give the press broader protection than the First Amendment provides. In O’Neill v Oakgrove Constr. (71 NY2d 521 [1988]), the Court held that article I, § 8 provides a qualified reporter’s privilege against disclosure of noneonfidential photographs, though no such privilege had been recognized by the United States Supreme Court. In support of its decision, the Court in O’Neill observed that
“the expansive language of our State constitutional guarantee, its formulation and adoption prior to the Supreme Court’s application of the First Amendment to the States, the recognition in very early New York history of a constitutionally guaranteed liberty of the press, and the consistent tradition in this State of providing the broadest possible protection to the sensitive role of gathering and disseminating news of public events all call for particular vigilance by the courts of this State in safeguarding the free press against undue interference.” (Id. at 528-529 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted].)
Article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution is not broader than the First Amendment in every case, however. For example, in Johnson Newspaper Corp. v Melino (77 NY2d 1 [1990]), the Court of Appeals declined to recognize a state constitutional right of access to professional disciplinary proceedings, stating that “[although our Court has in some cases found our State Constitution to be more protective of expressional freedoms than the Federal Constitution, there is no such precedent with respect to the right of access.” (Id. at 8 [citations omitted]; see also Santiago, supra [finding no New York or federal precedent for right to televise court proceedings].)
In determining whether the State Constitution provides broader protection for speech than the First Amendment in a particular case, the Court of Appeals “has not wedded itself to any single methodology, recognizing that the proper approach may vary with the circumstances.” (See Immuno AG. v Moor-Jankowski, 77 NY2d 235, 251 [1991] [deciding issue of defamation law on independent state grounds while taking federal law into account].) As a guiding principle, however, the Court has held that “[t]he function of comparable provisions of the State Constitution, if they are not to be considered purely redundant, is to supplement those rights to meet the needs and expectations of the particular State.” (See Cloud Books, supra at 557.) Thus, the burden here is on Court TV to demonstrate that the “needs and expectations” of New York necessitate an expansion of state constitutional rights beyond the federal minimum guarantee.
Court TV argues that article I, § 8 should protect the media’s right to televise trials because New York recognizes the media’s important role in “gathering and disseminating news of public events.” The implication is that New York citizens need and expect televised trials. The record does not support this position. To the contrary, the record shows that, after considerable experience, the Legislature (and the voters) remained unconvinced that the social value of televising trials outweighs the risks. In the Marist Poll, 61% of New York voters responded that audiovisual coverage of trials is a “bad idea.” At the very-least, the record raises a reasonable doubt that the needs and expectations of New York citizens demand a constitutional right to televised court proceedings. As a result, Court TV fails to meet its burden; on its face, Civil Rights Law § 52 does not violate article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution. The only New York appellate court to consider this issue came to a similar conclusion. (See Santiago, supra at 814 [“there is no precedent in New York recognizing (a right to televise court proceedings)”], citing Johnson, supra at 8.)
The Primacy of Fair Trial Rights in New York
Equally important, New York’s traditional respect for the fair trial principles embodied in the Sixth Amendment (codified as Civil Rights Law § 12) militates against adopting Court TV’s expansive reading of the New York Constitution. The Court of Appeals has held that “[n]ot only the individual defendant but the public at large is entitled to assurance that there shall be full observance and enforcement of the cardinal right of a defendant to a fair trial.” (See People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 238 [1975].) New York’s statutory scheme with respect to public access reflects the same paramount commitment to fair trials. Judiciary Law § 4 guarantees public access to trials; Civil Rights Law § 12 protects criminal defendants’ right to a fair public trial; and Civil Rights Law § 52 prohibits audiovisual coverage of trials. The combined effect of these statutes is that in New York, public access to trials is guaranteed, but fair trial rights take precedence where there is a conflict.
Indeed, New York appears to be unique among the states in addressing the “free press — fair trial” debate through explicit legislative commandments, instead of constitutional rules. (See Gannett, supra at 415 n 3 [45 states protect right to public trials through constitutional provisions; 2 through judicial decisions; 2 have no presumption of public trials; New York alone provides for public trials by statute].) At oral argument, Court TV suggested it is ironic that “in the state that probably has the most pro First Amendment type Constitution, the most pro press constitutional provision, we have a state that is one of nine left that has an absolute bar to cameras in the courtroom.” What Court TV labels ironic is more appropriately viewed as a reflection of the primacy in New York of fair trial rights where they conflict with the public right of access.
The record demonstrates that criminal trials are overwhelmingly more likely to be televised. With this in mind, it is worthwhile to examine New York jurisprudence with respect to the inevitable conflict between public access rights and fair trial rights in a criminal prosecution. In Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Leggett (48 NY2d 430 [1979]), the Court of Appeals summarized its approach to this question. Writing for the majority, Judge Wachtler admonished that
“any right of access to court proceedings accorded to the public and the press must also take into account the equally important rights of the accused. Complete freedom to speak and publish at will is, of course, the ideal and essential limitations on that freedom should be few and carefully scrutinized. But the true measure of our society will not be judged by the freedom we grant to our great institutions as much as by the protection we provide for society’s lowliest member. And none are more lowly — none more subject to potential abuse — and none with more at stake than those who have been indicted and face criminal prosecution in our courts. For them, freedom and fair trial are not abstractions.” (Id. at 443-444.)
Judge Wachtler’s words resonate with those of many who, throughout the 10-year experiment, spoke out to protect the fundamental right of criminal defendants to a fair trial. His emphasis on fair trial rights also is consistent with the purpose of section 52, i.e., to ensure witnesses’ fair opportunity to present testimony, and New York’s legislative scheme regarding public access to courts.
The impact of the Sixth Amendment on public access cases was recognized by Justice Blackmun in his concurring opinion in Richmond. Justice Blackmun lamented that the Supreme Court in Richmond “eschewed the Sixth Amendment route,” arguing that the Sixth Amendment, where the right to a public trial is expressly stated, provides the most appropriate framework by which to decide access issues. (See Richmond, supra at 603; see also Gannett v DePasquale, 443 US 368, 447 [1979] [“(t)o the extent the Constitution protects a right of public access to the proceeding, the standards enunciated under the Sixth Amendment suffice to protect that right”] [Blackmun, J., dissenting].) Commentators too have questioned the Richmond court’s decision to permit a qualified, implicit First Amendment right to “edge out” a fundamental, express Sixth Amendment right. (See, e.g., Sarner, supra.)
Against this backdrop, the court declines to establish a constitutional rule in New York granting the media a right to televise court proceedings. The record is consistent with the traditional approach of New York courts to public access questions, giving great weight to fair trial concerns. The record also is consistent with New York’s statutory scheme which guarantees public trials, but gives primacy to fair trial rights. Moreover, to the extent any changes to the statutory scheme have been put into experimental use, these were initiated and reviewed by the Legislature. A state constitutional rule expanding the rights of the media in New York to include the right to photograph and broadcast court proceedings would derail what is, and always has been, a legislative process.
The court recognizes that important issues raised by audiovisual coverage of trials in New York are not settled now, and, perhaps, always will generate strident opposing views. However, the court agrees with the advice of Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman: “[sjurely, a prominent public debate on the advisability of cameras in the courts is to be welcomed. But for the sake of certainty and finality it should take place and be resolved in the Legislature . . . .” In sum, the court concludes that there is no right of televised access under article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution.
For all of the above reasons, Court TV fails to make out a prima facie case supporting partial summary judgment. On the other hand, summary judgment is granted to defendants. Accordingly, it is ordered that plaintiff Courtroom Television Network LLC’s motion for partial summary judgment is denied; and it is further ordered that the summary judgment motions of defendants the State of New York, George E. Pataki and Eliot Spitzer are granted; and it is further ordered that, upon a search of the record, summary judgment is granted to defendant Robert Morgenthau; and it is further adjudged and declared that New York Civil Rights Law § 52, on its face, is not unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and it is further adjudged and declared that New York Civil Rights Law § 52, on its face, is not unconstitutional under article I, § 8 of the New York Constitution.

Though Morgenthau does not cross-move for dismissal here, he argues that he is not a proper party to this action, and that there is no “actual case or controversy” for the court to decide, because he has not prosecuted Court TV for violation of Civil Rights Law § 52. As Morgenthau has not moved to dismiss on this basis, the court declines fully to address these arguments. Were Morgenthau to so move, the court would be inclined to deny the application. “The general purpose of the declaratory judgment is to serve some practical end in quieting or stabilizing an uncertain or disputed jural relation either as to present or prospective obligations.” (James v Alderton Dock Yards, 256 NY 298, 305 [1931] [citations omitted and emphasis added].) Consistent with the guidance of the Fourth Department in Matter of Santiago v Bristol (273 AD2d 813 [2000]), Court TV brought this action to settle its prospective obligations under Civil Rights Law § 52. There is an actual controversy, in that some lower courts in New York have concluded recently that section 52 is unconstitutional. (See, e.g., Coleman v O’Shea, 184 Misc 2d 238 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 2000, Winslow, J.]; People v Boss, 182 Misc 2d 700 [Sup Ct, Albany County 2000, Teresi, J.].) Morgenthau is a proper party because he is vested with the power to enforce the statute. (See New York Foreign Trade Zone Operators v State Liq. Auth., 285 NY 272 [1941].) Indeed, courts have held that the declaratory judgment action is particularly appropriate to settle constitutional matters, even in preenforcement situations. (See, e.g., Lewis v American Fedn. of Tel. & Radio Artists, 71 Misc 2d 253 [NY County 1972, Quinn, J.], mod 41 AD2d 707 [1st Dept 1973], affd 34 NY2d 265 [1974] [declaratory judgment action properly brought by newscaster seeking to declare unconstitutional statute requiring union membership as condition of employment].)
. The bill “was passed in the Senate unanimously and with one dissenting vote in the Assembly.” (Statement of Senator Helman regarding L 1952, ch 241, 1952 NY Legis Ann, at 44-45.) The media voiced opposition. For example, Joseph H. McConnell, president of NBC New York, urged Governor Dewey not to approve the bill, on the ground that it unfairly discriminated against “radio, television and motion picture reporting.” (See Bill Jacket, L 1952, ch 241, at 6.)
. See Grygiel, Memorandum of Law of Regional News Network, 63 Alb L Rev 1003, 1019 (2000).
. The Court in Richmond strongly suggested that the First Amendment rights it recognized would also apply in civil trials. (See id. at 580 n 17.) Subsequently, some federal courts have so held. (See, e.g., Westmoreland v Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 752 F2d 16, 23 [2d Cir 1984], cert denied sub nom. Cable News Network v United States Dist. Ct, 472 US 1017 [1985].)
. See Issues at 4 (“As the May 31, 1989 sunset date of the initial experiment approached, there was much debate concerning the fate of the program, with proponents such as the media, the Cameras in the Courtroom Advisory Committee, and Judge Rosenblatt calling it a success and opponents such as the New York State Bar Association, the New York State Defenders Association and numerous legislators pronouncing the program a failure in terms of its stated purpose”).
. The members of the advisory committee included Dr. Irving Crespi, an opinion research consultant; Dr. Elizabeth E Loftus, a professor of psychology and adjunct professor of law; Richard D. Heffner, a professor of communications and public policy; and Harry M. Rosenfeld, editor of the Albany Times Union. (Crosson Report at [iv].)
. The Honorable Burton B. Roberts, Administrative Judge of the Twelfth Judicial District, was appointed committee chair. The chief administrator’s additional appointments were Honorable Richard A. Brown, the District Attorney of Queens County and Sam Roberts, a New York Times reporter. The Governor’s appointees were Eleanor S. Applewhaite, Esq., General Counsel of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, S. Paul Conti, Jr., assistant news director of WNYT-TV in Albany, and Edward W Hayes, Esq., an attorney in Manhattan. The Senate Majority Leader’s appointees were Philip M. Damashek of Damashek Godosky & Gentile and Richard N. Winfield, Esq., of Rogers & Wells. The Assembly Speaker’s appointees were Floyd Abrams, Esq., of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Harry M. Rosenfeld, editor of the Albany Times Union. The Senate Minority Leader’s appointee was Jack T. Litman, Esq., of Litman, Asche, Lupkin & Gioiella. The Assembly Minority Leader’s appointee was Richard Aurelio, president of Time Warner-NYC Cable Group. (Roberts Report at 19.)
. Though Litman doubted the objectivity of members of the press with respect to cameras in courts, he cited Max Frankel, who wrote, in an October 16, 1994 New York Times magazine article, that “the camera is not just another incarnation of ‘press,’ entitled to the unabridged freedom thereof. It’s a different beast that should enter a court by a different door, under different rules . . . .” (Frankel, I Am Not a Camera, New York Times, Oct. 16, 1994, at 28.)
. Cited in Thaler, The Watchful Eye: American Justice in the Age of the' Television Trial, 20 (1994).
. Apparently, four, rather than two, media representatives were appointed to the committee (Feerick Committee). The Governor’s appointees were Richard Alteri, president of the Cable Television and Telecommunications Association of New York; Professor Jay C. Carlisle, II, of Pace University School of Law; and Henry G. Miller of Clark, Gagliardi & Miller. The Chief Judge’s appointees were committee chair John D. Feerick, Dean of Fordham University School of Law; Honorable Friz. W Alexander II, counsel, Epstein, Becker & Green; and Veronica G. Dumas, Assistant District Attorney, Albany County. The Senate Majority Leader’s appointees were Monte Trammer, president and publisher of the Saratogian & Community News, and Professor James M. Tien, chair of the Decision Sciences and Engineering Systems Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The Assembly Speaker’s appointees were Leonard Noisette, director of Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, and Alissa Pollitz Warden, associate dean of the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Albany. The Senate Minority Leader’s appointee was Dianne Kennedy, president of the New York Newspaper Publishers Association. The Assembly Minority Leader’s appointee was Michelle Rea, executive director of the New York Press Association.
. The section headings are drawn directly from the Feerick Report.
. As an example of the judicial accountability benefit, the Committee also cited the testimony of Steven Brill, who stated (referring to the O.J. Simpson trial) that “[i]t is ridiculous to criticize journalism because journalism covers a public function and makes it look bad. If the system looked bad in that case, that is a benefit of cameras.” (Id. at 32.)
. OCA data regarding media applications between January 31, 1995 and September 1, 1996 showed that “94% of the proceedings in which camera coverage was sought were criminal cases.” (Id.)
. “The Committee received only two specific complaints about the way in which trial judges administered the provisions of Section 218 of the Judiciary Law, only one of which appeared to fall within the period of the legislative mandate.” (Feerick Report at 43.)
. Here, the Committee cited the testimony of Wyoming County Public Defender Norman Effman, who felt that “cameras have an impact” on trial participants. (Feerick Report at 54-55.) Mr. Effman’s clients primarily were “minority inmates charged with committing felonies within the [state] prisons” located within his 99% white county. In these cases, Mr. Effman felt that the presence of cameras would be “a protection against juror bias.” (Roberts Report at 62.) He believed that “jurors will be more inclined to act fairly if they know that people from less homogeneous parts of the State are watching.” (Id.)
. The Committee cited testimony as to witness impairment from Jonathan Gradess, executive director of the New York State Defenders’ Association, Peter Moschetti and Isaiah Gant of the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. (Feerick Report at 57; but see testimony of Professor Barry Scheck, an attorney in the O.J. Simpson trial, that “television coverage of the Simpson case led a key defense witness to come forward who might otherwise not have realized the relevance of her testimony,” id.)
. For example, Noisette pointed out that only 10% of judges surveyed strongly agreed that television coverage had enhanced public understanding of the judicial system, while 25% strongly disagreed, and 26% somewhat disagreed. (MR2 at 5.) Similarly, 61% of the public in the Marist Poll believed that television in the courtroom was “more a source of entertainment than something that would increase the public’s understanding of the justice system.” (Id.) Noisette wrote that “these statistics resoundingly rebut the bald assertions of self-interested journalists, and they are a dose of reality for those hopeful, disinterested witnesses regarding the educational benefits of cameras in our courts. They are the voice of New Yorkers voting for the sunset of this law.” (Id. at 6.)
. Defendants point out that a 1996 survey of California judges also revealed that witnesses were affected by audiovisual coverage of trials. There, 47% of all judges surveyed, and 59% of those surveyed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, reported observing a change in witness behavior. Those who witnessed a change in witness behavior characterized it predominantly as either “guarded testimony” (49%) or “self-conscious/nervous” (87%). (See Rosen affidavit, exhibit L, attachment 1, question 30.)
. It appears that the inclusion of this provision in the Assembly bill left it with little realistic chance of passage in the Senate, and even offended its initial sponsor, Democratic Assemblyman Mark Weprin of Queens, who dropped his name from the bill.

0250-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Helen E. Freedman, J.
This is a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1), (2) and (7) to dismiss the complaint and the claims set forth therein based on documentary evidence and on jurisdictional and statutory grounds, including time limitations. As class representatives, plaintiffs seek to recover a share of the proceeds of defendants’ successful prosecution of the RIAA v MP3.com litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The latter concerned distribution over the Internet of digital audio files.
Parties
Plaintiffs are individual recording artists who, as long ago as the 1950’s, signed recording contracts with defendant companies or their predecessors, which granted master recording and licensing rights to defendants or their assignors. Plaintiff Tony Silvester, doing business as the Main Ingredient, is a citizen of New York who has recording contracts with RCA Records, as predecessor to defendant BMG Entertainment, Inc., dated 1969, 1972, 1980 and 1981, and one or more record contracts with Polydor Records, as predecessor to defendant Universal Music Group, Inc., dated 1989. Silvester and the other plaintiffs were primarily members of the named groups, and still hold rights to perform under those names. Lester Chambers, doing business as The Chambers Brothers, is a citizen of California who has recording contracts with Columbia Records, predecessor to Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., dated 1966 and 1969. Carl Gardner, doing business as The Coasters, is a citizen of Florida who has record contracts with Atlantic Records, predecessor to defendant Time Warner, Inc., et al., dated 1955, 1959 and 1965. Bill Pinkney, doing business as The Original Drifters, is a citizen of South Carolina, and has created master recordings pursuant to contracts with Atlantic Records, predecessor to Time Warner, Inc., and other record labels. Various defendants also have licensing and cross licensing agreements to use Pinkney’s works dated 1959, 1961, 1964 and 1970.
Defendants Time Warner, Inc., Universal Music Group, Inc., Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., and BMG Entertainment, Inc. are successors in interest to companies with which plaintiffs have recording contracts and are all either incorporated in New York or have principal places of business in New York.
Claims
Plaintiffs’ Claims
Plaintiffs claim to represent a class of thousands of recording artists and their heirs, executors, successors and assignees who, at various times between 1956 and February 1, 1996, signed master recording agreements with defendants or their predecessors in interest. The gist of the complaint is that the recording contracts gave defendants no right to exploit plaintiffs’ work in digital format. Plaintiffs allege that they and other proposed class members have no agreements with any defendant which authorize or entitle defendants to exploit plaintiffs’ sound recordings in any form other than as phonograph records or other “analog media.” Plaintiffs claim that their contracts, for which they receive trailing royalties for previously recorded works, did not confer rights on defendants to exploit the sound recordings through digital media including compact discs (CD’s) and digital audio files that can be distributed over the Internet and across computer networks. Plaintiffs also claim that their contracts do not constitute the full agreements between the parties because they are subject to the terms and provisions of the National Codes of Fair Practice for Sound Recordings of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (the phono codes), a series of collective bargaining agreements between the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) and record producers, which plaintiffs contend provide that the sound recordings could not be used in any medium other than phonograph records.
Plaintiffs aver that the new digital mastering technology that record companies adopted in the early 1980’s enabled recordings to be copied without the loss of sound quality or distortions associated with the copying of analog recordings; thus digitalization was not permitted by the contracts or phono codes. Before the release of CD’s in digital form, sound recordings could only be distributed in fixed tangible analog media (vinyl records or tapes). In or about 1999, an audio format, “MP3,” was developed, allowing digital audio files to be compressed into much smaller files with little degradation of sound quality, which in turn made distribution over the Internet and across computer networks much easier (and permitted consumers to download digital audio files containing plaintiffs’ and other class members’ recordings at low or no cost). Plaintiffs also claim that various members of the recording industry, by prosecuting claims against MP3.com and Napster, Inc., obtained settlements of approximately $15 to 20 million and warrants to purchase shares of MP3.com common stock and licensing fees of at least $6 million in exchange for releases. Plaintiffs claim that defendants had no right to enter into any agreements with MP3.com or Napster licensing the right to distribute sound recordings in digital form over the Internet.
Specifically, plaintiffs and putative class members seek compensatory and punitive damages for the following allegations. Plaintiffs allege defendants breached express and implied provisions of the recording contracts, as modified by the “phono codes,” by digitalizing recordings and allowing or facilitating distribution of recordings over the Internet, without protecting plaintiffs’ rights to royalties and licensing fees. Plaintiffs also claim copyright infringement pursuant to 17 USC § 501 (b) (the Copyright Act of 1976), and seek “equitable” shares of defendants’ recovered damages for copyright infringement in the federal courts, specifically one half of the infringement damages or other proceeds obtained by defendants from MP3.com in the MP3.com litigation and an accounting of all payments already made to songwriters and others to recoup improper payments. Plaintiffs assert that defendants have “judicially admitted” that they will share the MP3.com proceeds with all artists whose sound recordings appeared on the MP3.com Web site, based on a statement during argument before the Second Circuit. They also admitted a contractual agreement to share proceeds with Tony Silvester. Additionally, plaintiffs claim that defendants negligently and recklessly exposed class members to the risk of music piracy by releasing sound recordings in digital audio files on CD’s, and that defendants breached both implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing and a fiduciary obligation to protect plaintiffs’ beneficial interests or property rights in their sound recordings.
Defendants’ Claims
Defendants move to dismiss on the basis that the plain language of each of the recording agreements in question provided that in exchange for royalties, plaintiffs gave all of their rights in the sound recordings to the record companies. Additionally, defendants claim that the Copyright Act does not provide for equitable apportionment; thus plaintiffs would not be entitled to any portion of the proceeds of the settlements in the copyright infringement litigation against MP3.com, Inc. They further assert that Copyright Act claims are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and that they have already been dismissed by the federal court. (Chambers v Time Warner, Inc., 123 F Supp 2d 198 [SD NY 2000], vacated and remanded 282 F3d 147 [2d Cir 2002] [dismissed without prejudice based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction on June 27, 2002].) With respect to the various other claims, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defendants assert that the plain terms of the contracts define the duties of each party and that neither a fiduciary duty nor covenants not contained in the contracts exist independently. Finally, defendants claim that the claims are time-barred because plaintiffs’ claims accrued in the early 1980’s when CD’s were first developed and marketed.
History
All of the claims asserted in this action were the subject of a second amended complaint brought by plaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The original complaint was dismissed by the Honorable Jed Rakoff in Chambers v Time Warner, Inc. (123 F Supp 2d 198 [SD NY 2000] [but vacated and remanded 282 F3d 147 (2d Cir 2002); on remand again dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on June 27, 2002]). The claims were refiled here pursuant to 28 USC § 1367 (d), as authorized by the stipulated order of the court. The Second Circuit vacated and remanded the original decision of the Southern District on the ground that the District Court considered matters outside the pleadings in determining the motion to dismiss.
Discussion
Motion to Dismiss
In determining a motion to dismiss, the court’s role is ordinarily limited to determining whether or not the complaint states a cause of action. (Frank v DaimlerChrysler Corp., 292 AD2d 118 [1st Dept 2002].) However, where documentary evidence and undisputed facts negate or dispose of the claims in the complaint or conclusively establish a defense, dismissal may be granted pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (1). (Biondi v Beekman Hill Hous. Apt. Corp., 257 AD2d 76 [1st Dept 1999]; Kliebert v McKoan, 228 AD2d 232 [1st Dept 1996]; Gephardt v Morgan Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y., 191 AD2d 229 [1st Dept 1993]; Juliano v McEntee, 150 AD2d 524 [1st Dept 1989]; see also Leon v Martinez, 84 NY2d 83 [1994]; Frank v DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra.)
Breach of Contract Claims
Based on the submissions contained here, it appears that all of the original agreements contain provisions conveying full ownership rights to the master recordings to the defendant companies or their predecessors. While there is some variation among the contracts, they all contain language identical or similar to the following: “All recordings, phonograph record masters and reproductions made therefrom, together with the performances embodied therein, shall be entirely [the record company’s] property. [The record company] shall have the unrestricted right to manufacture, use, distribute and sell sound productions of the performances recorded hereunder made by any method now known, or hereafter to become known.” (Atlantic contract; see also Columbia contract, RCA contract, PolyGram contract, affirmation of Katherine B. Forrest.)
Such contracts have been interpreted according to their plain meaning. The words by any method now or hereafter known or to become known, which are contained in these contracts, clearly anticipate development of new technologies. (See discussion in Greenfield v Philles Records, 98 NY2d 562 [2002].)
In Greenfield v Philles Records (98 NY2d 562 [2002]), the Court of Appeals, interpreting a recording artist’s contract transfer of ownership rights to a record company, held that in the absence of “an explicit contractual reservation of rights by the artists,” the “artists’ transfer of full ownership rights to the master recordings of musical performances carried with it the unconditional right of the producer to redistribute those performances in any technological format.” (98 NY2d at 566.) That case involved the right of Philles Records to license master recordings for synchronization and redistribution of domestic licenses in 1987 based on a 1963 contract. The Court found that, despite the technological innovations that are revolutionizing the recording industry, long-settled common-law contract law governed. The broad contractual provisions of the agreements conveying to the defendants the “right to make phonograph records, tape recordings or other reproductions of the performances embodied in such recordings by any method now or hereafter known” (id. at 568-569) was a clear and unambiguous provision that authorized defendants to license performances for use in all visual media, i.e., television or movies. The Court stated that “a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.” (Id. at 569.)
The conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals in Greenfield (supra) mirrored that reached by Judge Rakoff in the Southern District action when he stated
“This language (and the equivalent language in the other contracts) is clear. Without limitation it conveys all of plaintiffs’ rights in these recordings to the [r]ecord [c]ompanies, including the right to exploit the recordings by any method whatsoever, whether known at the time or ‘hereafter to become known.’ ” (Chambers, 123 F Supp 2d at 200.)
Plaintiffs claim that, somehow, the fact that the recording contracts here were subject to AFTRA union contracts or “phono codes” distinguishes their situation from that of the Ronettes in Greenfield is not persuasive. The phono codes are a series of fair practices agreements between AFTRA and the record companies which govern minimum wage and fee compensation and terms, including minimal payments for benefits to welfare funds and conditions for the engagement of artists making phonograph recordings. They do not affect the broader contractual provisions that convey the artists’ property rights to the record companies. In fact, the language of some of the AFTRA agreements or the phono codes specifically permits copying of master recordings on “microgroove recordings or tape or any other similar or dissimilar device now or hereafter devised.” (1962 AFTRA contract, provision 8; see also Chambers, 123 F Supp 2d at 201 [rejecting the claim that AFTRA contracts affect the recording contracts; thus the breach of contract claims must be dismissed].)
Breach of Fiduciary Obligation
Plaintiffs’ complaint states a claim that defendants breached a fiduciary obligation owed to defendants. However, under New York law, an artist’s assignment of rights to a record company in exchange for royalties is contractual and does not create a fiduciary relationship or duty. Unless parties can show a separate duty other than to perform under the contract, no fiduciary relationship between them is established. (Sony Music Entertainment, Inc. v Robison, 2002 WL 272406, 2002 US Dist LEXIS 3100 [SD NY 2002]; Savage Records v Jones, 247 AD2d 274 [1st Dept 1998]; Rodgers v Roulette Records, Inc., 677 F Supp 731 [SD NY 1988]; Mellencamp v Riva Music, Ltd., 698 F Supp 1154 [SD NY 1988]; Carter v Goodman Group Music Publs., 848 F Supp 438 [SD NY 1994]; see also, Evans v Jelly’s Jams, Sup Ct, NY County 2002, Index No. 601308/01 [“a contract for the collection and payment of royalties on music, does not, by itself, give rise to a fiduciary relationship”].) Moreover, actions for monetary damages from breach of fiduciary duty are governed by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in CPLR 214 (4). (Matter of Kaszirer v Kaszirer, 286 AD2d 598 [1st Dept 2001]; Loengard v Santa Fe Indus., 70 NY2d 262 [1987]; Yatter v William Morris Agency, 256 AD2d 260 [1st Dept 1998].) Plaintiffs’ claims that creation and distribution of their works through digital media resulted in a breach of fiduciary duty accrued in the early 1980’s when digital audio files on CD’s were first released and sold. The argument that there was a continuing breach is unavailing because the underlying alleged breach occurred when the production of digital audio files permitted piracy to occur in the first instance. {See Woodlaurel, Inc. v Wittman, 199 AD2d 497 [2d Dept 1993] [holding that the statute of limitations runs when a party making the demand first becomes entitled to make it whether or not the party is aware that it may have a cause of action].) Plaintiffs further claim that the damages did not accrue until the late 1990’s, when third parties downloaded the digital files and transmitted them over computer networks, does not state a claim against defendants. In fact, once the downloading occurred, defendants aggressively pursued claims against these third parties, in the Napster and MP3.com litigations, the results of which will accrue to the benefit of plaintiffs.
Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
The claims for breach of good faith and fair dealing do not state an independent cause of action. Every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, such covenant does not impose any obligation upon a party to the contract beyond what the explicit terms of the contract provide. (Poley v Sony Music Entertainment, 163 Misc 2d 127 [Sup Ct, NY County 1994].) Where, as here, no party has acted in a way to prevent the performance of or the rights under the contract, the claim must fail. (Maxon Intl. v International Harvester Co., 82 AD2d 1006 [3d Dept 1981], affd 56 NY2d 879 [1982] [where defendant did what the contract expressly permitted, there is no evidence of bad faith].) Here, there is no claim that defendants intentionally interfered with plaintiffs’ rights to obtain royalties under their contracts. (PVM Oil Futures v Banque Paribas, 161 AD2d 220 [1st Dept 1990].) In fact, the pursuit of claims in the copyright litigations indirectly furthered plaintiffs’ interests under the contracts, inasmuch as in the federal actions, defendants sought to eliminate piracy to protect recording sales, the source of plaintiffs’ royalties. Finally, breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing are subject to a six-year statute of limitations. (Liberman v Worden, 268 AD2d 337 [1st Dept 2000].)
Negligence Claim
Plaintiffs also assert that defendants negligently failed to protect plaintiffs’ rights to maximize royalties by releasing digital files that were subject to piracy. However, such claim is unavailing because the contractual rights specifically provide for the right to exploit the copyrighted sound recordings in “future technologies,” which clearly includes compact discs and other digital media. A plaintiff cannot transform a claim for breach of contract into a negligence claim by merely alleging a breach of due care. “[A] simple breach of contract is not to be considered a tort unless a legal duty independent of the contract itself has been violated.” (Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Is. R.R. Co., 70 NY2d 382, 389 [1987].) The only possible claim for negligence is the creation of digital audio files that were subject to piracy. Compact discs were first created or distributed some 20 years ago (1983) and, therefore, a claim arising from that act is time-barred under CPLR 214 (6). The piracy occurred many years later in 1999 and 2000, and, in fact, defendants aggressively pursued claims against the wrongdoers in the Napster and MP3.com litigations; the injunctions obtained in those lawsuits will accrue to the benefit of plaintiffs.
Copyright and Equitable Apportionment Claims
Plaintiffs’ claim for equitable apportionment pursuant to section 501 (b) of the Copyright Act does not state a cause of action and, if it did, would not be enforceable in this court. The Copyright Act does not give rights to “beneficial owners” to equitable apportionment of damages recovered for infringement. It merely allows legal or beneficial owners to bring actions for copyright infringement. (17 USC § 501 [b].) Moreover, rights under the copyright laws may only be enforced in federal courts (28 USC § 1338 [a]; Estate of Hemingway v Random House, 53 Misc 2d 462 [Sup Ct, NY County 1967], affd 29 AD2d 633 [1st Dept 1967], affd 23 NY2d 341 [1968]; Shaw v Kastner, 151 Misc 2d 654 [Sup Ct, NY County 1991].)
Plaintiffs’ claim for equitable apportionment under New York law is also unsupported. The only such claim recognized by New York law arises out of apportionment of damages among tortfeasors, which is not the case here. Plaintiffs also claim that in the MP3.com litigation, they were promised 50% of the recovery because of a statement made by defendants in the Second Circuit, which they deem a judicial admission, entitling them to an equitable claim in this court. However, such a claim belongs in the forum where it was allegedly made and where its validity can be determined in an appropriate context. The transcript of the Second Circuit argument does not support this claim and indicates that the promise related to obtaining royalties under the contract.
Based on the foregoing, the claims set forth are hereby dismissed and the clerk is directed to enter judgment for defendants.",0
0381-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
David Elliot, J.
The plaintiff, appearing pro se, is a tenant at defendant’s apartment building and sues to recover for damage sustained to her property as a result of a burst water pipe concealed in a wall at the location of her apartment. It is the plaintiffs position that the defendant was negligent and is responsible for the damage because of a history of not attending to routine maintenance of the pipes, despite knowledge of the deteriorated condition of the building’s pipes. As evidence of this, the tenant alleges that at her last apartment in the same building a number of years ago, another pipe broke, causing damage to her property, and that there were other problems with pipes in the building, but that the landlord acted only in response to leaks, as opposed to performing any routine maintenance. The defendant landlord failed to present any evidence or witnesses.
Neither party placed a copy of the lease into evidence. However, Multiple Dwelling Law § 78 (1) provides in pertinent part: “Every multiple dwelling, including its roof or roofs, and every part thereof and the lot upon which it is situated, shall be kept in good repair. The owner shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section . . . .” The landlord’s duty of keeping the premises in good repair having been established, the issues before the court are whether by her uncontradicted testimony the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of a negligent breach of that duty, and whether the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case.
In Dillenberger v 74 Fifth Ave. Owners Corp. (155 AD2d 327, 327 [1989]), the Appellate Division, First Department, upheld the granting of summary judgment to the proprietary lessee of a building owned by defendant, for damages sustained when water pipes in an adjacent common area burst, holding that “The court properly granted summary judgment based on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur which gave rise to a permissible inference of negligence which was not rebutted by evidentiary proof in admissible form” (citations omitted). The Appellate Division, Second Department, has held that the doctrine is applicable to a sprinkler system, finding that “Where the owner is in exclusive possession and control of the system, it is reasonable to assume that any break in the system was caused by the owner’s neglect.” (Payless Discount Ctrs. v 25-29 N. Broadway Corp., 83 AD2d 960, 961 [1981], citing De Witt Props. v City of New York, 44 NY2d 417 [1978].) While the Court of Appeals held that the doctrine was not applicable to that particular case involving a water main because of the involvement of a utility company, the Court cited George Foltis, Inc. v City of New York (287 NY 108 [1941]), in which the Court of Appeals stated: “We agree that under the rule of res ipsa loquitur the plaintiff’s proof that its property was damaged by a break in a water main constructed and controlled by the city was sufficient to establish prima facie that the injury was due to negligence of the city.” (George Foltis, Inc. v City of New York, supra at 118.) The First Department, citing the Payless case, held with regard to a burst steam pipe that “The evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s conclusion that defendant had constructive notice of the deteriorated condition of the steam pipes, and, we would add, was also sufficient to establish liability under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.” (Swain v 383 W. Broadway Corp., 216 AD2d 38, 38 [1995].)
In this case, the court finds that the plaintiff did make out a prima facie case of negligence, as her uncontroverted testimony revealed that the defendant had actual notice of the deteriorated condition of the pipes in the building, as well as constructive notice of the condition of the pipe in question. Further, the court finds that under the facts as presented in this case, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies. As the plaintiffs testimony, as well as the presumption of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was not challenged by any evidence or testimony, the court finds that the plaintiff must prevail on the issue of liability for the damage sustained by the plaintiff.
The court had the opportunity to observe the testimony of the plaintiff and her witness, and to assess the credibility of the witnesses. While the court accepts the testimony of the plaintiff as to the happening of the event giving rise to this lawsuit, it appeared that in an effort to prove her damages, the plaintiff merely brought with her to court every receipt she could find for her possessions. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover for damaged clothing and sneakers in the amount of $264.87, plus bedding in the sum of $319.22, and a “Playstation” and joystick in the sum of $214.98. The photographs introduced into evidence by the plaintiff and her testimony do not support her claim of damage to her furniture. Further, while the plaintiff alleged that there is something wrong with the color on her television, there was no evidence to indicate the extent of damage or the cost of repair.
After trial, the clerk is therefore directed to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $799.07, with interest from February 23, 2003.",0

Richard E. Sise, J.
Claimants Wanji Webb, an infant, and Evelyn Cramer, his grandmother and court appointed guardian, seek damages for the unjust conviction of Wanji Webb.
The claimant herein was adjudged to have committed the act of attempted assault in the third degree on March 15, 1999 by a fact-finding order of Family Court Judge Fran L. Lubow. On May 11, 1999 Judge Lubow entered a disposition finding that the act committed by the claimant would have, if committed by an adult, constituted the crime of attempted assault in the third degree, and adjudged Wanji Webb a juvenile delinquent. He was, thereafter, placed in the custody of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services for a period of one year (claimant’s exhibit B).
On November 6, 2000, the Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed the May 11, 1999 disposition and vacated the fact-finding order of March 15, 1999, and dismissed the petition CMatter of Wanji W., 277 AD2d 243 [2000]).
The State moves to dismiss on the following grounds: (1) that the adjudication by the Family Court does not constitute a “conviction” as defined by the statute (Court of Claims Act § 8-b [3]), and (2) that the verification requirement of the statute has not been met (Court of Claims Act § 8-b [4]).
The attorney for this claimant contends that the adjudication of a juvenile delinquent satisfies the conviction requirement of section 8-b of the Court of Claims Act (Kaufman affirmation in opposition at 1 [unpaginated]). He also maintains that the verification was proper (Kaufman affirmation in opposition at 7).
In support of its application on the first cited ground, the State argues that an adjudication as a juvenile delinquent does not come within the ambit of the statute which requires that the claimant have been convicted of a crime, sentenced to a term of imprisonment and have served all or part thereof. In reviewing section 8-b cases, the Court of Claims has given hegemony to the purpose and language of the Legislature. It was the announced purpose of the Legislature to compensate those who had been unjustly convicted of a crime and who had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Nothing in the legislative history gives any indication that the statute was to apply to cases involving those who were adjudicated as delinquents. Neither did the wording of the statute evidence such a contention. Also, the attorney for the claimant has failed to submit any case where this court has ever held that the statute has been applied to a delinquent. On the contrary, one case has been cited which holds that the statute does not apply to individuals who were adjudicated a delinquent and who later had the petition dismissed. In Pabon v State of New York (Apr. 9, 1993, Albert A. Blinder, J., Claim No. 82806), Judge Blinder ruled that since a claimant who had been adjudicated a delinquent cannot prove that he was convicted of a crime, such a claim cannot stand (exhibit C annexed to notice of motion at 3-4).
Claimant’s attorney seeks to distinguish this case based upon the severity of the instant claimant’s assignment to the Auburn Residential Center. His attempt is unpersuasive.
The court finds the logic of Judge Blinder compelling and, accordingly, will follow it. The court has held on numerous occasions that section 8-b created a new cause of action, and as such must be strictly construed (see Alston v State of New York, 97 NY2d 159 [2001]; Paris v State of New York, 202 AD2d 482 [1994]). Therefore, since the claimant is unable to establish that he was convicted of a crime and imprisoned, he does not fall within the ambit of those whom the Legislature sought to compensate. The fact that claimant’s placement was more severe than other adjudicated delinquents does not change that result.
Similarly, on the issue of verification, the court has held that the statute required verification by the claimant himself. The rationale for such a holding is that only the individual himself could attest to the fact of his innocence (see Pejcinovic v State of New York, Aug. 8, 1997, Christopher J. Mega, EJ., Claim No. 89358; Vasquez v State of New York, June 30, 1995, Albert A. Blinder, J., Claim No. 83301).
The language of the statute itself states that the claim must be in sufficient detail and “[t]he claim shall be verified by the claimant.” (Court of Claims Act § 8-b [4].) Had the Legislature wanted to permit verification by someone other than the person convicted, that is, under the same procedure and standards applicable to claims in general, it did not have to use the above-quoted language. Also, given the fact that the statute is a unique statutory cause of action and the claim of innocence is the linchpin of the section, it is not improper to consider the verification requirement an integral part of the remedy. Accordingly, the court finds the verification defective and that this defect is fatal.
After reviewing the claim, the court finds that no cognizable cause of action exists on behalf of the claimant, Evelyn Cramer, for loss of services, nor has the attorney for claimant submitted any opposition to the defendant’s motion to dismiss as it relates to the second and third causes of action (Kaufman affirmation in opposition, at 1 [unpaginated], para 2). Accordingly, the claim is hereby dismissed in its entirety.
. The claimants did not oppose the motion as to the remaining causes of action.
. All references to the claimant refer to Wanji Webb.
. It has also been held that a defective verification cannot be corrected (see Pejcinovic v State of New York, supra at 3-4).",0
0035-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Per Curiam.
Final judgment entered September 13, 2002 reversed with $30 costs, and final judgment of possession granted in favor of tenant dismissing the petition.
The facts are not contested in this nonprimary residence holdover. The tenant of record is Joseph Silverberg, a physician in Rochester, who rented the apartment premises on West 87th Street in June 1998 for $2,050 per month. As found by Civil Court, the parties to the lease “were fully aware from the start” that tenant was renting the premises for the exclusive use of his daughter Terri Silverberg, a recent college graduate who did not have a credit history. There was no issue as to primary residence at that time, as the rent had been set at a deregulated amount.
Shortly after the commencement of the tenancy, a rent overcharge claim was filed with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The present landlord settled the claim by refunding over $17,000 to the tenant, agreeing that the legal regulated rent was $656, and by renewing the lease for an additional two years. However, landlord sought possession at the expiration of that term on the ground that the apartment was not Dr. Silverberg’s primary residence. Civil Court granted the petition, reasoning that the prior landlord preferred Dr. Silver-berg as a tenant because he was more creditworthy; he had never resided in the apartment; and that Terri Silverberg “has no right to renew although it was clear to all parties that she would be the one living in the apartment, because the lease did not name her as such.”
On these singular facts, we conclude that while Dr. Silverberg was the nominal tenant, the actual contemplated resident— understood as such from the inception of the tenancy — was Terri Silverberg. No other person has resided in the premises. It is manifest that the lease was granted to Dr. Silverberg rather than his daughter for the purpose of financing a rental which substantially exceeded the amount that could lawfully be collected, effectively removing from the market an existing stabilized apartment (see generally, Draper v Georgia Props., 230 AD2d 455 [1997], affd 94 NY2d 809 [1999]). Now that the premises has been restored to the aegis of the rent stabilization system, landlord should not be permitted to capitalize on the lease arrangement by evicting the real party in interest, i.e., Terri Silverberg, who was recognized as the true occupant from the outset; who, in fact, has primarily resided in the apartment; and who is therefore within the class of those entitled to protection under the regulatory scheme.
Cases such as Avon Bard Co. v Aquarian Found. (260 AD2d 207 [1999]), cited below, are inapposite as they involve leases to corporate entities with the possibility of a perpetual tenancy in the absence of identifiable individual occupants (see, Matter of 20 W. 76th St. v Division of Hous. & Community Renewal, 306 AD2d 6 [2003]).

Janice A. Taylor, J.
Ordered that the motion is decided as follows:
CPLR 8020 (a), as amended by section 25 of part J of chapter 62 of the Laws of 2003, provides, in pertinent part, that “whenever a county clerk renders a service in his capacity as clerk of the supreme or a county court, in an action pending in such court,” the county clerk “shall be entitled to a fee of forty-five dollars upon the filing of each motion or cross motion in such action. However, no fee shall be imposed for a motion which seeks leave to proceed as a poor person pursuant to subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred one of this chapter.”
The movant, Joan E. Flowers, Esq., was appointed by this court as special guardian of the property of the incapacitated person in this guardianship proceeding pursuant to article 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law on August 12, 2002. The court exercised its discretion to dispense with the filing of a bond, to obviate the unnecessary expense to the special guardian. The special guardian filed a motion on or about November 4, 2003 seeking to be discharged without settling a final accounting in this guardianship proceeding. The motion was accepted for filing by the guardianship clerk’s office without payment of the statutorily-mandated filing fee upon authority of Justice Thomas’ decision in Matter of Richter (NYLJ, Nov. 14, 2003, at 19, col 1 [Sup Ct, Queens County]), and placed on this court’s calendar on November 26, 2003.
For the reasons which follow, this court concludes that CPLR 8020 (a), as drafted by the Legislature, does not contain any exemption for court-appointed fiduciaries (other than court examiners which are considered public officers not subject to such fees), and accordingly, all motions made by such fiduciaries require the payment of a $45 filing fee as a prerequisite to being entertained by the court.
As Justice Graffeo of our Court of Appeals recently wrote in her dissenting opinion in People v Cahill (2 NY3d —, —, 2003 NY Slip Op 18881 [2003]),
“Our function as judges is to interpret this law. ‘The governing rule of statutory construction is that courts are obliged to interpret a statute to effectuate the intent of the Legislature’ (People v Finnegan, 85 NY2d 53, 58 [1995]). The ‘ “clearest indicator of legislative intent” ’ is the statute itself (People v Robinson, 95 NY2d 179, 182 [2000], quoting Majewski v Broadalbin-Perth Cent. School Dist., 91 NY2d 577, 583 [1998]). If the language chosen by the State Legislature is clear and unambiguous, and ‘involves no absurdity or contradiction, there is no room for construction and courts have no right to add to or take away from that meaning’ (Tompkins v Hunter, 149 NY 117, 123 [1896]; see People ex rel. Harris v Sullivan, 74 NY2d 305, 309 [1989]). When this doctrine is violated, a court impermissibly encroaches upon the legislative and executive domains and thereby violates the foundation of the separation of powers doctrine (see People v Finnegan, 85 NY2d at 58).” (Emphasis added.)
The governing rule of statutory construction is that courts are obliged to interpret a statute to effectuate the intent of the Legislature, and when the statutory “language is clear and unambiguous, it should be construed so as to give effect to the plain meaning of [the] words” used (People ex rel. Harris v Sullivan, 74 NY2d 305, 309 [1989], citing Doctors Council v New York City Employees’ Retirement Sys., 71 NY2d 669, 675 [1988]; Patrolmen’s Benevolent Assn. v City of New York, 41 NY2d 205, 208 [1976]). Equally settled is the principle that courts are not to legislate under the guise of interpretation (see, People v Heine, 9 NY2d 925, 929 [1961]; see also, Bright Homes v Wright, 8 NY2d 157, 162 [I960]).
Nowhere in the legislative history of this statute is there any indication that the intent of this statute is to prevent frivolous motion practice by litigants. Any argument to the contrary is misplaced. (Cf., Matter of Richter, supra.) There are already vehicles in place in both the CPLR and the Uniform Rules for Trial Courts to stem the tide of such practices.
The Governor’s Memorandum in Support of his budget bill, submitted to the Senate and Assembly on January 29, 2003, indicated that
“Assigned counsel rates have not been increased in 17 years and are generally acknowledged to be too low to assure an adequate supply of attorneys willing to participate. This bill increases the rates and provides sufficient revenue to cover the State’s estimated annual costs ($24 million) and to allow creation of a local assistance program that would effectively reimburse one-half of the local cost increase ($40 million).
“The Court Facilities Incentive Aid Fund provides financial assistance to local governments for the construction and maintenance of court facilities. Increasing Civil Court fees and imposing Supreme and Appellate motion fees helps ensure that annual revenues more closely approximate projected annual costs.” (Governor’s Mem in Support S 1406/A 2106 [2003] <http://publications.budget.state.ny.us/ fy0304articleVIIbilIs/ppgg_memo.html> [accessed Dec. 31, 2003].)
The Governor also noted that
“Currently, there are no fees imposed for filing motions in Supreme or Appellate courts in New York State. A number of other states, however, impose motion fees at rates similar to the recommended new fee of $35. A motion fee, unlike a filing fee, does not restrict access to the courts in the first instance. It can be further argued that those who consume more of the judicial system’s resources should pay accordingly.” (Id.)
The budget legislation eventually passed as section 25 of part J of chapter 62 of the Laws of 2003 by the Senate and Assembly (S 1406b, A 2106b), over the Governor’s veto on May 15, 2003, incorporated the Governor’s proposal for new filing fees on motions and cross motions, changing only the suggested amount of said fees from $35 to $45 per motion and cross motion. Nowhere in the legislative history does this court find any discussion of an exemption, either explicit or implicit, for fiduciaries in guardianship proceedings.
As indicated by the history of the legislation, after raising the state expenditure for “18B” counsel, the Legislature put in place revenue raising measures in part J of chapter 62 to defray this expense. Thus, the clear intent of sections 23, 24 and 25 of part J of chapter 62 is to raise revenue within the auspices of the state budget. (See, Doe v State of New York, NYLJ, Aug. 4, 2003, at 24, col 5 [Sup Ct, NY County, DeMaro, J.]; see generally, David D. Siegel, Outside Counsel, New Fees for Making Motions Are Effective Today, NYLJ, July 14, 2003, at 4, col 4.)
Thus, carving a substantive and categorical exclusion out of the statute, no matter what the practical or policy motivations behind it, is simply ultra vires, beyond this court’s allocated role in the distribution of law-making authority, and is nothing less than the functional equivalent of judicial legislation. (See, e.g., Matter of Richter, supra.) If the Legislature had intended an exclusion for all court-appointed fiduciaries, such as guardians, guardians ad litem, court-appointed attorneys and court evaluators, and other appointees charged with advising the court and preparing final accountings, on the ground that they are public officers who are, in effect, an extension of the court (other than court examiners which clearly function in such capacity), the Legislature would have drafted section 8020 (a) of the CPLR accordingly. Established principles of statutory interpretation require this court to conclude that the failure of the Legislature to include such an exception in a statute is a strong indication that its exclusion was intended. (See, People v Finnegan, supra at 58.) This is further buttressed by the fact that the statute incorporates such an exemption for those seeking leave to proceed “as a poor person,” but not those acting as court-appointed fiduciaries for incapacitated persons.
Since the court-appointed fiduciary necessarily stands in the shoes of the incapacitated person, in an instance in which there are limited resources to reimburse the fiduciary for the filing of required motions in guardianship cases, the proper procedure would be for the fiduciary to utilize the above exemption to apply to have the incapacitated person designated a “poor person” and have the fees waived in the proceeding. (See, CPLR 1101.) It is certainly never this court’s intent to “financially hamstring” the appointed fiduciary in cases involving a corpus with de minimis resources. Furthermore, where there are available funds, the court is empowered to reimburse the fiduciary for appropriate fees. The court does not make it a practice, however, to reimburse fees, and thereby diminish the corpus of the incapacitated individual for redundant motion practice occasioned by, for example, an oversight on the movant’s part in failing to properly effectuate service or to properly set forth the factual and/or legal basis for the motion.
By reason of the foregoing, this court holds that guardianship proceedings under article 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law should be treated the same way under the fee-sponsoring legislation as any other proceeding. In a special situation, such as that at bar, involving a motion to settle a final account in guardianship proceedings, which generates two orders, only a single motion fee should be collected.
The acceptance for filing of motions in guardianship proceedings, such as that at bar, without the payment of a requisite fee contravenes the express language of the statute and the purposes behind it. If an exception for court-appointed fiduciaries in guardianship proceedings was intended, or is desired, by the Legislature, then this court calls upon the Legislature to act to amend CPLR 8020 (a) to provide for such exemptions. Absent such legislative revision, this court declines to ignore the clear language and intent of the statute by entertaining applications which are not accompanied by a fee, to rewrite the clear and unambiguous language of the statute, or to exceed its judicial mandate by directing the county clerk’s office to ignore the unambiguous words of the legislation. (Cfi, Matter of Richter, supra.)
Accordingly, the motion is denied, with leave, to renew upon payment of the fee required by CPLR 8020 (a).",0
0057-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Memorandum.
Judgment affirmed without costs.
At issue before this court is whether, based upon either an absolute or a qualified privilege, plaintiffs should be relieved from liability for the statements contained in a letter, faxed to an attorney who previously represented defendant, and to defendant himself, that were found to be defamatory by the verdict of the jury, which awarded defendant $25,000 in compensatory and $20,000 in punitive damages on his counterclaim.
The statements, which accused the defendant of having embezzled funds that he had held in escrow in his capacity as plaintiffs’ former attorney, were libelous inasmuch as they accused him of a serious crime and tended to injure him in his profession (Armstrong v Simon & Schuster, 85 NY2d 373 [1995]; Liberman v Gelstein, 80 NY2d 429 [1992]; Marcus v Bressler, 277 AD2d 108 [2000]; Chiavarelli v Williams, 256 AD2d 111 [1998]).
Plaintiff Amy Afshari admitted participation in the preparation and publication of the letter, and while not á signatory thereto, she was properly held jointly liable for the defamation (Parker v Hujuelos, 1991 WL 158976, 1991 US Dist LEXIS 11331 [ED NY, July 15, 1991]; Kjar v Jordan, 217 AD2d 981 [1995]; Brown v Mack, 185 Misc 368 [1945]).
Where defamatory statements are unrelated to any pending litigation between the parties, the doctrine of absolute privilege is inapplicable (Park Knoll Assoc. v Schmidt, 59 NY2d 205 [1983]; Caplan v Winslett, 218 AD2d 148 [1996]; Petrus v Smith, 91 AD2d 1190 [1983]; Uni-Service Risk Mgt. v New York State Assn. of School Bus. Officials, 62 AD2d 1093 [1978]; Kenny v Cleary, 47 AD2d 531 [1975]).
Plaintiffs failed to raise the affirmative defense of qualified privilege in their answer to the counterclaim, or at the trial of this action. Consideration of the qualified privilege at this late juncture would effectively deprive defendant of his “day in court” on his counterclaim (Aponte v Cosmopolitan Empl. Agency, 226 AD2d 299 [1996]; Uliano v Entenmann’s, Inc., 148 AD2d 604 [1989]). We note, in any event, that a review of the record on appeal fails to support said defense. Moreover, it is also apparent that plaintiffs acted with malice, thereby defeating the shield provided by a qualified privilege (see Liberman v Gelstein, 80 NY2d 429 [1992], supra).
In light of the foregoing, the judgment awarding defendant damages on his counterclaim for defamation should be affirmed. We find plaintiffs’ other contentions raised on appeal to be without merit.
Golia, J., dissents in part and votes to modify the judgment by dismissing defendant’s counterclaim in the following memorandum: Pro se plaintiffs appeal from a judgment in favor of the defendant on his counterclaim for libel in connection with a “faxed” letter sent to defendant by plaintiffs. It is uncontroverted that the subject letter was sent by the plaintiffs and that it was libel per se in that it accused the defendant (an attorney) of committing the crime of embezzlement concerning money retained in a prior matter. However, the thrust of the letter was an attempt to recover a sum of money which the defendant attorney had retained, as his fee, from an escrow account while handling a house closing for the plaintiffs.
The majority on this court is voting to affirm the judgment entered in the lower court. The court finds that there is no absolute privilege to be afforded to the plaintiffs who were former clients of defendant and were also defendants in a prior lawsuit by the same attorney for legal fees. The majority finds that inasmuch as these pro se plaintiffs did not plead the affirmative defense of qualified privilege nor did they attempt to prove it at the trial, that this court cannot consider the defense of a qualified privilege.
I, however, dissent from the holding of the majority and vote to dismiss the counterclaim on the law.
In the matter before us the plaintiffs had an ongoing and continued history with defendant Mr. Barer, in which the plaintiffs had engaged the defendant to perform various legal services over several years. One such service was to represent the plaintiffs in the purchase of a private residence in 1992 which cost approximately $2.5 million. It was a fee dispute concerning this transaction that constitutes the underlying claim by plaintiffs in this action seeking the return of $10,000 which was retained by this defendant attorney as his legal fee.
The defendant’s counterclaim for libel was based upon a letter “faxed” to him immediately prior to the commencement of this action and immediately after a settlement was entered in a prior lawsuit between the parties concerning a separate fee dispute. That letter was faxed to the defendant at this law office in which he and other individuals share space, including the fax machine, office staff, services, etc.
A careful examination of the trial record and the court papers reveals that the defendant failed to plead any specific individuals to whom the letter was published which is a fatal blow to a claim for libel, in this Judicial Department (see Arsenault v Forquer, 197 AD2d 554 [1993]). Moreover, “[t]he reading of an allegedly libelous communication by someone who is not the addressee does not constitute a publication unless the author intended the person to read it” (Hochberg v Nissen, 180 AD2d 435, 436 [1992]).
In order to support a claim for libel, the claimant (defendant herein) must plead and prove that the defamatory writing, through some act or the carelessness of the writer (plaintiff herein), is read by or otherwise communicated to someone other than the person defamed (Weidman v Ketcham, 278 NY 129 [1938]).
In the case under consideration, Mr. Afshari “faxed” a letter to the attorneys who represented Mr. Barer in a fee dispute which was resolved by stipulation less than two weeks earlier. He also “faxed” the same, or similar letter, to Mr. Barer which may have been seen by other individuals in Mr. Barer’s office space.
It must be emphasized that the $10,000 at issue was money retained by defendant attorney from an escrow account during his representation of the plaintiffs in a house closing in 1992. Defendant attorney asserts he kept the money pursuant to an oral agreement that he could retain it as his fee and plaintiffs assert that there was no such agreement.
Irrespective of whether or not there was an agreement, defendant attorney was engaged to represent the plaintiffs in other ongoing legal matters which resulted in defendant attorney bringing an action against the plaintiffs for nonpayment of legal fees regarding those other matters. It was that lawsuit for legal fees which was resolved by stipulation on or about May 20, 1998 in which the plaintiffs herein agreed to pay the defendant herein $12,000.
Less than two weeks thereafter, the plaintiffs faxed the subject letter seeking a resolution of the $10,000 that they claim was improperly retained as a legal fee by the defendant while representing them in the 1992 house closing.
Although I agree that the letter was defamatory, I also believe that it was sent as a final attempt to obtain the $10,000 sum of money that the plaintiffs believed was rightfully theirs before “going public” with the information. It is therefore obvious to me that plaintiffs did not intend to have any third party read this letter, nor can they be deemed to be careless in the manner in which they transmitted the communication. It is clear to me that the pro se plaintiffs could not reasonably have anticipated that a letter faxed to an individual would be read by other associates in the office.
Accordingly, in the absence of any showing that the defamatory statement was published to a third person, I have no alternative but to vote to modify the holding of the lower court and to dismiss the counterclaim.
I do not reach the concerns expressed by the other members of this bench on the issue regarding the failure to plead and prove the affirmative defense of qualified privilege. Inasmuch as the counterclaim must be dismissed on its face, there is no need to address any defense, affirmative or otherwise.
Accordingly, I dissent in part from the opinion of my colleagues on the bench and would vote to modify the judgment appealed from by dismissing the counterclaim.

Memorandum.
Order unanimously affirmed without costs.
Having requested that the court grant them permission to interpose a counterclaim for money plaintiff allegedly owed them for the subject vehicle repairs, as well as other affirmative relief, defendants waived any defect in personal jurisdiction, and by seeking to interpose such a claim, defendants have made affirmative use of the very court that they allege has no jurisdiction (Textile Tech. Exch. v Davis, 81 NY2d 56 [1993]).
Defendants failed to show reasonable excuse and a meritorious defense upon their motion to vacate the default judgment entered against them in this action for breach of contract to repair a vehicle in a workmanlike manner, and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants’ motion in the circumstances of this case (see e.g. Roussodimou v Zafiriadis, 238 AD2d 568 [1997]).
Plaintiff requested in his opposition to defendants’ motion that the court render assistance to him in collecting the judgment. Defendants’ motion papers and brief each state that “Shane’s Towing LLC” is a “successor” to Shane’s Towing Inc., and the motion further alleged that plaintiff owed over $3,000 to “SHANE’S TOWING LLC, aS SUCCeSSOT to SHANE’S TOWING INC.” Given this admission of legal successor status, the court properly exercised its discretion in amending the caption to reflect the corporate defendant’s current name in response to plaintiff’s request that the court assist in the enforcement of the judgment (cf. New Medico Assoc. v Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 267 AD2d 757 [1999] [holding that CPLR 1003, as amended, allows the court, on its own motion, only to drop, and not to add, parties]).
Nor did the court improperly refuse to credit defendants’ affidavit, in which defendants’ affiant, among other things, requested permission to interpose a counterclaim that patently contradicted the documentary evidence in the matter (see e.g. Petrovski v Fornes, 125 AD2d 972 [1986]).
Defendants’ remaining contentions have been considered and are without merit.

George B. Ceresia, Jr., J.
In 1958 Congress declared that it was in the national interest to develop a nationwide highway system to be financed through federal aid (see, 23 USC § 101 [b]). In furtherance of this objective Congress, in 1966, adopted the Highway Safety Act (23 USC § 401 et seq.; see, Pierce County v Guillen, 537 US 129 [2003]). The purpose of the act was to improve highway safety by encouraging closer federal and state cooperation with respect to road improvement projects (see, id. at 133). Toward this end, Congress, in 1973, adopted what is known as the Highway Hazard Elimination Program (see id.-, see also, 23 USC § 152). Under the program, each state was required to systematically prepare and maintain an engineering survey of all public roads. The purpose of the survey was to identify roadside hazards and hazardous conditions, to assign priorities for the correction of hazards, and to establish and to implement a schedule of projects for their improvement (see, id.). In 1987, Congress adopted 23 USC § 409 which generally provided (as relevant here) that information compiled by states pursuant to 23 USC § 152 could not be admitted into evidence in any action for damages. 23 USC § 409 was amended in 1991 (amended by Pub L 102-240, tit I, § 1035 [a], 105 US Stat 1978) to direct that such information not only is not admissible at trial, but also it may not be the subject of discovery.
On September 13, 2002 petitioner submitted an application to the respondent pursuant to Public Officers Law article 6, commonly known as the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). As relevant here, the application requested disclosure of respondent’s priority list of hazardous intersections and locations for regions 10 and 11 and the schedule of projects for improving each priority, as well as related data. The documents which petitioner seeks are referred to as priority investigation location (PIL) lists and priority investigation intersection (PII) lists. By letter dated November 8, 2002 respondent denied the application pursuant to Public Officers Law § 87 (2) (a) on grounds that the information was exempt from disclosure under 23 USC § 409. The statute in question recites as follows:
“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data compiled or collected for the purpose of identifying, evaluating, or planning the safety enhancement of potential accident sites, hazardous roadway conditions, or railway-highway crossings, pursuant to sections 130, 144, and 152 of this title or for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction improvement project which may be implemented, utilizing Federal-aid highway funds shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State court proceeding or considered for other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence at a location mentioned or addressed in such reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data.” (23 USC § 409.)
Petitioner submitted an administrative appeal of the FOIL denial. By letter dated January 9, 2003, respondent granted petitioner access to a portion of the information sought, specifically, a list of projects whose benefits include safety improvements for locations on the priority lists.
Petitioner maintains, inter alia, that the plain language of 23 USC § 409 makes clear that its purpose was not to render such materials confidential, but rather to assure that they could not be subject to discovery, or used as evidence in actions for damages.
The assistant counsel for the respondent characterizes the PIL and PII lists as confidential records generated by the respondent’s traffic engineers under the Highway Safety Improvement Program administered by respondent pursuant to 23 USC § 152. The lists are described as indications, based upon preliminary statistical analysis, of the advisability of investigating particular highway locations or intersections based upon accident rates. It is indicated that respondent’s traffic division prepares the PIL and PII lists on a regional basis to assist the regional traffic engineers in planning the annual work of the engineers under their supervision, in furtherance of the Highway Safety Improvement Program. Respondent indicates that it has adopted a policy, pursuant to Public Officers Law § 87 (2) (a) and 23 USC § 409 under which the PIL and PII lists are deemed exempt from disclosure under FOIL.
Respondent’s records access officer indicates that a significant portion of the FOIL requests which she handles come from attorneys representing clients in highway tort claims litigation. In her view the FOIL applications are motivated by the attorneys’ desire to supplement records obtained from the office of the New York State Attorney General through the pretrial discovery process.
Among the arguments advanced by respondent in opposition to the FOIL request, respondent maintains that if the request is granted (thus opening the doors of such FOIL requests to personal injury litigants), parties to personal injury actions will attempt to examine state officers and employees concerning information gleaned from the lists. This, in turn, will result in burdensome and time-consuming motion practice as the State makes application for various forms of protective relief under 23 USC § 409. Respondent also raises an argument predicated on a theory of federal preemption.
It is settled law that FOIL is based on the overriding policy consideration that “the public is vested with an inherent right to know and that official secrecy is anathematic to our form of government” (Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, 47 NY2d 567, 571 [1979]). The Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that FOIL is to be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly interpreted so that the public is granted maximum access to the records of government (see, Matter of Capital Newspapers, Div. of Hearst Corp. v Whalen, 69 NY2d 246, 252 [1987]; Matter of Washington Post Co. v New York State Ins. Dept., 61 NY2d 557, 564 [1984]; Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, supra at 571; Matter of Citizens for Alternatives to Animal Labs v Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y., 92 NY2d 357 [Oct. 22, 1998]).
All agency records are presumptively available for public inspection and copying, unless the documents in question fall within one of the enumerated exemptions set forth in Public Officers Law § 87 (2) (see, Matter of Encore Coll. v Auxiliary Serv., 87 NY2d 410, 417 [1995]; Matter of Hanig v State of N.Y. Dept. of Motor Vehs., 79 NY2d 106, 109 [1992]; Matter of Legal Aid Socy. of Northeastern N.Y. v New York State Dept. of Social Servs., 195 AD2d 150, 152 [1993]). Blanket exemptions for particular types of documents are inimical to FOIL’S policy of open government (see, Matter of Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v Burns, 67 NY2d 562, 569 [1986]; Gould v New York City Police Dept., 89 NY2d 267 [1996]). The exemptions available are to be narrowly construed, and “the agency seeking to prevent disclosure bears the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the particular exemption claimed” (Matter of Legal Aid Socy. of Northeastern N.Y. v New York State Dept. of Social Servs., supra at 153; see, Public Officers Law § 89 [4] [b]; see, Matter of Hanig v State of N.Y. Dept. of Motor Vehs., supra at 109; see also, Matter of Daily Gazette Co. v City of Schenectady, 93 NY2d 145, 158-159 [1999]). The agency at issue must “articulat[e] a particularized and specific justification for denying access” to the requested documents (Matter of Capital Newspapers, Div. of Hearst Corp. v Burns, supra at 566; Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, 47 NY2d 567, 571 [1979]; Gould v New York City Police Dept., supra at 275 [1996]).
Petitioners point out that at least two foreign state courts have dealt with the applicability of 23 USC § 409 in public records disclosure proceedings. In Seaton v Johnson (898 SW2d 232 [Tenn App 1995]) the petitioner, pursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act (see, Tenn Code Ann § 10-7-503), sought records compiled and kept by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The Tennessee Court of Appeals found that section 409 preempted the Tennessee Public Records Act, thus barring disclosure of the records. In Guillen v Pierce County (144 Wash 2d 696, 31 P3d 628 [2001], revd in part 537 US 129 [2003]) the applicant sought records under Washington State’s Public Disclosure Act (see, Wash Rev Code Ann ch 42.17). The Washington State Supreme Court determined that the 1995 amendment to section 409 violated the Federal Commerce Clause. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the 1995 amendment to section 409 did not violate the Federal Commerce Clause (see, Pierce County v Guillen, 537 US 129 [2003]). Significant to this proceeding, the Washington Supreme Court never questioned the applicability of section 409 to a proceeding brought pursuant to Washington State’s Public Disclosure Act.
Turning first to respondent’s argument concerning federal preemption, as stated in Monfort v Larson (257 AD2d 261 [3d Dept 1999], lv dismissed 94 NY2d 875 [2000]):
“Congressional preemptive intent is discernible in three alternate ways: ‘(1) expressly in the language of the Federal statute; (2) implicitly, when the Federal legislation is so comprehensive in scope that it is inferable that Congress intended to fully occupy the “field” of its subject matter; or (3) implicitly, when State law actually “conflicts” with Federal law’ (Drattel v Toyota Motor Corp., 92 NY2d 35, 42).” (Monfort v Larson, supra at 263 [3d Dept 1999].)
While Congress clearly declared that the records in question could not be the subject of discovery, or introduced into evidence within the context of an action for damages, the court finds nothing in the language of section 409 to convey an intent on the part of Congress, either expressly or implicitly, to preempt the field as it relates to public records disclosure. Nor does the court discern a direct conflict between section 409 and FOIL.
Notably, by the time Congress amended section 409 in 1991 many states, if not all, had enacted public disclosure legislation. It would have been an easy matter for Congress, at the time it was then expanding the scope of section 409, to make clear that the section 409 exemption also applied to public records disclosure.
The controlling principle, in the court’s view, is that which recites that FOIL is to be liberally construed, and that exemptions under FOIL are to be narrowly interpreted so that the public is granted maximum access to the records of government (Matter of Capital Newspapers, Div. of Hearst Corp. v Whalen, 69 NY2d 246, 252 [1987], supra; Matter of Hanig v State of N.Y. Dept. of Motor Vehs., 79 NY2d 106, 109 [1992]; Matter of Mantica v New York State Dept. of Health, 94 NY2d 58, 61 [1999]; see, Matter of Farbman & Sons v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 62 NY2d 75, 80 [1984]). In narrowly construing section 409, the court finds that said section does not apply to FOIL requests. Under the circumstances, the court concludes that the petition must be granted.
The petitioner has made a request for an award of counsel fees. As stated in Matter of Corvetti v Town of Lake Pleasant (239 AD2d 841 [3d Dept 1997]):
“ ‘It is well settled that “[a] party may receive counsel fees in a FOIL proceeding when it is established that (1) the petitioner substantially prevailed, (2) the record requested was of ‘clearly significant interest to the general public’, and (3) ‘the agency lacked a reasonable basis in law for withholding the record’ ” ’ (Matter of URAC Corp. v Public Serv. Commn., 223 AD2d 906, 907, quoting Matter of Powhida v City of Albany, 147 AD2d 236, 238, quoting Public Officers Law § 89 [4] [c] [i], [ii]). However, even if these elements are met, an award of counsel fees remains within the discretion of the court (see, Matter of URAC Corp. v Public Serv. Commn., supra, at 907; see also, Public Officers Law § 89 [4] [c]).” (Matter of Corvetti v Town of Lake Pleasant, supra at 843-844.)
It is evident from the foregoing that the petitioner has substantially prevailed in the proceeding and that the records in question are of “clearly significant interest to the general public.” Upon the instant record however, and particularly in view of the interest which respondent sought to protect, the court cannot find that the respondents did not have a reasonable basis to withhold the documents. Under the circumstances, the court finds that the application for attorney’s fees and costs must be denied.
Ordered and adjudged that the relief requested in the petition be and hereby is granted to the extent that that portion of respondent’s determinations dated November 8, 2002 and January 9, 2003, which denied petitioner’s freedom of information request dated September 13, 2002, be and hereby are vacated and annulled; and it is further ordered and adjudged that, within 30 days, respondent make available to petitioner the items specified in petitioner’s freedom of information application dated September 13, 2002 not previously furnished; and it is further ordered and adjudged that petitioner’s application for costs and attorney’s fees is denied.",0

Howard A. Ruditzky, J.
Motion by plaintiff NYCTL 1996-1 Commercial Reo, LLP for an order, pursuant to CPLR 3212, granting summary judgment in its favor and against defendants herein, the motion by plaintiff for an order, pursuant to RPAPL 1352 and Real Property Law § 220, awarding reasonable use and occupancy payments to plaintiff and directing defendants El Pequeño Restaurant Food Corp., doing business as El Pequeño Restaurant, and Mona Bella Corp. (collectively, defendants) to pay such arrearages, and the cross motion by said defendants for an order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action are consolidated for disposition herein and, upon consolidation, the motions by plaintiff are granted and the cross motion by defendants is denied.
This is an action for strict foreclosure of the interests of the occupants of the real property known as 8603-8605 18th Avenue in Brooklyn (the premises). Plaintiff acquired the premises by virtue of a referee’s deed, pursuant to a judgment of foreclosure and sale in a tax lien foreclosure action. Plaintiff now moves to strike the answer of El Pequeño Restaurant Food Corp. and Mona Bella Corp. and for summary judgment on its claim for strict foreclosure. Plaintiff also moves for an order directing said defendants to pay use and occupancy to plaintiff for the period during which plaintiff has held title to the premises.
In seeking summary judgment, plaintiff asserts that its complaint recites all the necessary elements required to commenee a strict foreclosure action and that defendants’ defenses are without merit. Specifically, plaintiff alleges, among other things, that service of process was properly effected, that the action is timely and that plaintiffs interests in the premises are superior and paramount to those of defendants. Plaintiff points out that, even if judgment were granted in its favor, defendants would have the opportunity to exercise their right of redemption. Although plaintiff concedes that there was an error in failing to name defendants in the original tax lien foreclosure action, the error was neither deliberate nor prejudicial since “[t]he remedy for holders of an interest not named in a foreclosure action pursuant to Article 13 of the RPAPL is that they are to be given the right to redeem,” the very reason for the commencement of this action. Plaintiff notes that, even if defendants could prove that they possess a valid lease to the subject premises subsequent to the foreclosure sale on April 21, 1999, they have not made any rent payments to plaintiff. Therefore, by separate motion, plaintiff requests an award against defendants reflecting the reasonable use and occupancy for the premises. In this case, plaintiff suggests that the amount be calculated based upon the sums that defendants were supposed to pay pursuant to their alleged lease with Ro-Rob Realty Corp., the prior owner of the premises.
In their cross motion (and in opposition to the motions), defendants fault plaintiff for failing to explain why it did not name them in the tax lien foreclosure action, given that defendants’ occupancy of the premises was “open and notorious,” and why it took three years after plaintiff discovered the existence of the tenancy to commence the instant action. According to defendants, plaintiffs error constitutes a “willful neglect” and plaintiff should therefore be precluded from commencing a reforeclosure action against them pursuant to RPAPL 1503. Defendants also argue that their interests in the premises are paramount to those of plaintiff since they were not served in the underlying foreclosure action and plaintiff took title to the premises “subject to the rights of tenants and occupants.” Moreover, defendants maintain that the instant action is untimely since it was commenced in September 2002, “more than six (6) years after the original default was declared.” Defendants also assert that “plaintiffs request for amounts in excess of the lease must be denied.”
In opposition to the cross motion, plaintiff contends that it has an absolute right to bring an action in strict foreclosure to extinguish the subordinate interest of a party not named in the original foreclosure action and that the issue of whether plaintiff had knowledge of that interest is irrelevant. Plaintiff notes that defendants’ reference to “willful neglect” is erroneous since this is an action for strict foreclosure pursuant to RPAPL article 13 and not a reforeclosure action pursuant to RPAPL article 15. Plaintiff dismisses defendants’ objection to the amount sought for use and occupancy since the amount is based upon the purported lease which defendants claim is in effect. While plaintiff concedes that defendants’ rights pursuant to the lease may not have been terminated by the judgment of foreclosure and sale, it adds that the lease can be terminated by strict foreclosure (i.e., the instant action). Finally, plaintiff contends that there is no statute of limitations on the commencement of an action to foreclose a tax lien but, even if one could argue that á six-year statute of limitations was applicable, this action was instituted less than six years after the commencement of the tax lien foreclosure action.
There is no provision in the law specifically limiting the time for the institution of an action to foreclose a tax lien. The New York City Charter expressly recites that all taxes shall “become liens on the real estate affected thereby . . . and shall remain such liens until paid” (§ 1519 [2]). Therefore, contrary to defendants’ contentions, plaintiffs right to foreclose on its tax lien is not subject to a six-year statute of limitations. The life and validity of a tax lien are not affected by the lapse of time (see L.K. Land Corp. v Gordon, 1 NY2d 465 [1956]). Plaintiff stands in the same position as the City with respect to its rights and remedies as a holder of a tax lien (Administrative Code of City of NY § 11-332 [a]; Maspeth 5718 Assoc. v City of New York, 292 AD2d 453 [2002]). If its remedy of foreclosure were subject to the statute of limitations, so too would be the City’s as to liens that it holds. Under the circumstances, therefore, plaintiffs claims are not time-barred (see Russell v City of New York, 22 AD2d 706 [1964]).
A tenant in possession pursuant to a lease (which is subordinate to a mortgage or lien) who was not made a party to the foreclosure action cannot be dispossessed by the purchaser at the foreclosure sale (see 3 Bergman, New York Mortgage Foreclosures § 33.04 [2]). In such cases, the purchaser of the foreclosed property has two potential remedies — the commencement of a strict foreclosure action pursuant to RPAPL 1352 or a reforeclosure action pursuant to RPAPL 1503. Here, the plaintiff purchaser opted to commence a strict foreclosure action. Therefore, defendants’ arguments regarding “willful neglect” are inapplicable (see RPAPL 1503).
Since a tenant has an equitable right to redeem his or her landlord’s mortgage, which is not extinguished when the mortgagee omits the tenant as a party in the foreclosure action, a tenant comes within the class of persons against whom a strict foreclosure action can be brought (see 6820 Ridge Realty v Goldman, 263 AD2d 22, 28 [1999]). Accordingly, since plaintiff is entitled to maintain a strict foreclosure action against defendants and the defenses interposed are without merit, the mo- . tion by plaintiff for summary judgment is granted.
Moreover, since defendants are required to pay for their use and occupancy of real property owned by plaintiff (see Real Property Law § 220; Dyker Bldrs. Corp. v Markogiannis, 274 AD2d 373 [2000]), plaintiff’s companion motion is likewise granted. Under the circumstances, it is appropriate to base the free market rental value of the premises on the terms of the lease which defendants claim is in effect (see Davis v Cole, 193 Misc 2d 380 [2002]).
In light of the foregoing, the cross motion by defendant is denied.
Plaintiff and defendants previously moved for the relief requested herein. By decision and order dated March 21, 2003, the motions and cross motion were denied with leave to renew upon submission of affidavits of service reflecting service upon the individual defendants herein. The renewed motions and cross motion have complied with that requirement, although defendants have chosen to designate the instant cross motion as one to restore their original cross motion.",0

Kenneth L. Gartner, J.
The instant action is for personal injuries allegedly sustained in a motor vehicle collision.
The plaintiff moves for an order striking the defendants’ answer pursuant to CPLR 3126 (3) for the defendants’ alleged refusal to obey a prior order of this court.
The first issue which must be addressed is the competence of this court — rather than the court which signed the prior order — to adjudicate this motion.
This case was commenced in Supreme Court. The case was transferred to the District Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d). CPLR 325 (d) permits the involuntary removal of actions from Supreme Court to a court of limited jurisdiction, albeit with Supreme Court’s unlimited monetary jurisdiction intact, “where it appears that the amount of damages sustained may be less than demanded,” and “the lower court would have had jurisdiction but for the amount of damages demanded.”
While the instant case was pending in Supreme Court, the parties entered into a preliminary conference stipulation and order before the Supreme Court Justice assigned. The plaintiff subsequently made a motion for sanctions based upon the defendants’ alleged noncompliance with the discovery schedule contained in that order.
Following the case’s transfer to the District Court, the motion for sanctions came on before the District Court Judge then assigned. The parties entered into a written stipulation settling the motion, and establishing dates for the defendants’ depositions, which was “so-ordered” by the assigned judge.
When the time came for the “compliance conference” scheduled in the stipulation, the parties appeared and entered into yet another written stipulation, setting new dates for the defendants’ depositions. A new judge having by that time been assigned, that new judge “so-ordered” the new stipulation.
The plaintiffs’ instant motion is premised upon the defendants’ alleged disobedience of the most recent so-ordered stipulation. It is asserted, however, that pursuant to CPLR 2221 (a), this court is required to mandatorily transfer this motion to the judge who “so-ordered” that stipulation, and that this court has not the authority to hear and determine it.
An historical review reveals that over time, a volume of cases were removed to the District Court pursuant to CPLR 325 (d) (325 [d] transfers). For some time, each 325 (d) transfer was assigned to a particular District Court Judge, who was expected to address the judge’s docket of 325 (d) transfers while simultaneously handling the judge’s regular part assignments. This proved unwieldy, particularly since many parts of the District Court require disposition of lengthy calendars every morning, the conduct of hearings and trials emanating from those parts, and the giving of priority to criminal matters. Without the assistance of law secretaries, it proved difficult for the District Court Judges to give appropriate supervision and oversight, and afford timely jury trials, to their 325 (d) transfer case loads.
22 NYCRR 212.3 (b) permits the establishment within the District Court of such parts as may be designated by the chief administrator of the courts, including, pursuant to section 212.3 (b) (5), multipurpose parts. The problems in handling 325 (d) transfers would have been further exacerbated when the chief administrator established a number of criminal multipurpose parts to function on an IAS (Individual Assignment System) basis in criminal matters. (See, e.g., People v DeVito, NYLJ, Apr. 11, 2003, at 24, col 5 [Nassau Dist Ct, Fiechter, J] [making reference to the “newly formed IAS in District Court of Nassau County”].)
In order to facilitate the handling of 325 (d) transfers in a manner akin to the court from which they have been involuntarily transferred, the chief administrator thus also established within the District Court a 325 (d) Part, also to function as a multipurpose part, for the handling of 325 (d) transfers on an IAS basis. All 325 (d) cases were thereupon transferred to the 325 (d) Part.
CPLR 2221 (a) provides, inter alia, that a motion to reargue, renew, appeal from, stay, vacate, or modify a prior order “shall” be made to the judge who signed the order “unless he or she is for any reason unable to hear it.”
CPLR 2221 (b), however, provides that “[t]he chief administrator may by rule exclude motions within a department, district or county from the operation of subdivision (a) of this rule.” In Siegel, Practice Commentary (McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C2221:l, at 178), it is explained that: “[Subdivision (b), which was added to CPLR 2221 [when IAS went into effect] in 1986, is designed to assure that to whatever extent they may be inconsistent with the referral-back requirement of subdivision (a), any rules adopted by the court’s administrators take precedence.”
In Dalrymple v Martin Luther King Community Health Ctr. (127 AD2d 69, 72-73 [2d Dept 1987]), the Appellate Division affirmed an order entered by a Supreme Court IAS Justice granting reconsideration of a pre-IAS order, entered by a Special Term Justice, which had severed a third-party action. The Appellate Division noted that it had previously, in Blasi v Boucher (30 AD2d 674 [2d Dept 1968]), affirmed the vacation, by a trial justice before whom a motion was made returnable, of a conditional order of preclusion pursuant to CPLR 3126 which had been entered by a Special Term Justice, on the ground that there were “exceptional circumstances” justifying departure from the usual rule. The Appellate Division in Dalrymple went on to hold (at 72-73): “[T]he institution of the IAS . . . with the attendant assignment of all pending cases to individual Justices for trial, brought all these cases within the purview of the ‘exceptional circumstances’ rule . . . and outside a rigid literal interpretation of CPLR former 2221.” The Appellate Division further observed that (at 73) “ [judicial economy and the orderly administration of justice were best served by” such a result where the prior justice had limited continuing familiarity with the case, while the assigned justice “was fully familiar with the case and its background and the likely timetable for trial.”
The same reasoning was employed by the Appellate Division in Mullen v Flushing Hosp. (161 AD2d 748 [2d Dept 1990]), a case with a striking similarity to the issue at bar. The Appellate Division in Mullen — citing Dalrymple — held that “Justice Joy . . . properly entertained the appellant’s motion to dismiss the complaint as asserted against him for the plaintiffs failure to comply with a conditional order issued by another Supreme Court Justice approximately one year earlier. Having presided over the matter during that year, Justice Joy was most familiar with the circumstances underlying the plaintiff’s inability to comply with the order and in the best position to evaluate whether to impose sanctions therefor.” (At 749 [citations omitted].)
In fact, in Yuan Zhai v Chemical Bank (180 Misc 2d 442 [Civ Ct, NY County 1999]), it was held that a judge in a court of limited jurisdiction addressing a motion in a 325 (d) transfer has the power to vacate even an order — at least one issued on default — by a previously assigned Supreme Court Justice. Stated the court in that case, “[i]t makes absolutely no sense ... to punt this somewhat routine motion into the procedural quandary of transfer orders, where, as here, no countervailing judicial or party interest would be advanced thereby.” (180 Misc 2d at 448.) See also Siegel, Practice Commentary (McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C2217:l), addressing that provision permitting permissive transfer of any motion to a judge who has decided a prior one in the case. Professor Siegel (at 133) there observed that “some judges feel that the reference back is a shirking of duty, a kind of buck-passing that they prefer to avoid,” and that “[tjhe only really sensitive situation ... is that in which Judge Two proposes to dispose of the motion in such a way as to create substantial conflict with the earlier disposition by Judge One.”
In the instant case, no such situation is presented. In fact, the present situation presents an even stronger policy basis for this court retaining and entertaining the motion on its merits than was the case in Dalrymple and Mullen. The motion itself does not clearly fall into one of the categories of motions listed in CPLR 2221. The order underlying the motion does not represent an independent analysis and determination of the prior judge of this court, but merely the “so-ordering,” by one of the four judges who have been assigned successively to this case in the year and a half following its commencement, of a discovery stipulation of the parties. There is no issue of this court sitting in review of a court of coordinate jurisdiction. The only question is whether the court to whom the case is now assigned, and charged with overseeing discovery and either settlement or trial, should be the court to evaluate the question of whether sanctions should be imposed, and if so what sanctions and/or subject to what conditions. The statutory and judicial authority cited above makes clear that it should, and has the obligation to, do so.
Addressing the merits of the instant motion, the attorneys for defendants Julio Cesar Campos and Jose Campos make an uncontroverted showing that their inability to produce their clients for deposition has been due to difficulties in locating these defendants. The fact remains that this matter has gone on for too long, and there appears to have been some laxity in the conduct of the search.
The refusal of defendant Eisenhower Ortega to appear for deposition, while perhaps strategically sound, has been clearly willful.
The plaintiffs motion is therefore conditionally granted. The answer of each defendant is therefore stricken as to that defendant unless the defendant appears and submits to deposition within 45 days of the date of this order.",0

Dan Lamont, J.
Petitioners bring this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 seeking a judgment declaring and adjudging that respondent McCall’s September 6, 2002 findings of fact and conclusions of law overturning Hearing Officer Lomanto’s July 30, 2002 bench decision be vacated as arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, violative of law and in excess of respondents’ jurisdiction, and declaring that petitioners may file for Retirement and Social Security Law article 15, § 605 disability retirement benefits for and on behalf of respondent Faltermeier, and granting various other forms of relief. By decision/order dated April 30, 2003, this court denied respondents’ motion to dismiss the petition for (1) failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and (2) failure to join Gordon J. Faltermeier as a necessary party, and directed that Faltermeier be added as a party.
The state respondents have now filed an answer asserting that the petition fails to state a cause of action and reasserting their defense that petitioners have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Respondent Faltermeier has filed a notice of cross petition requesting that the relief in the petition be denied and that Faltermeier receive an accidental disability retirement at 75% of his final average salary.
This court’s April 30, 2003 decision/order is incorporated herein. This court’s prior decision/order determined that petitioners were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies because the respondent administrative agency has made a final determination on the issue of whether or not petitioners have the authority to file an application for Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 benefits where an employee has more than 10 years of service credit and is permanently disabled as a result of an injury resulting from the performance of his duties — without regard to the cause of such disability being accidental or not accidental. Respondent McCall determined that petitioners could not file an application for Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 benefits unless respondent Faltermeier’s permanent disability was the result of an accident sustained in the performance of his duties.
The Law
General Municipal Law § 207-c, “Payment of salary, wages, medical and hospital expenses of policemen with injuries or illness incurred in the performance of duties,” provides in applicable part as follows:
“1. Any sheriff, undersheriff, deputy sheriff or corrections officer of the sheriff’s department of any county (hereinafter referred to as a ‘policeman’) . . . who is injured in the performance of his duties or who is taken sick as a result of the performance of his duties so as to necessitate medical or other lawful remedial treatment shall be paid by the municipality by which he is employed the full amount of his regular salary or wages until his disability arising therefrom has ceased . . .
“2. Payment of the full amount of regular salary or wages, as provided by subdivision one of this section, shall be discontinued with respect to any policeman who is permanently disabled as a result of an injury or sickness incurred or resulting from the performance of his duties if such policeman is granted an accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to section three hundred sixty-three of the retirement and social security law, a retirement for disability incurred in performance of duty allowance pursuant to section three hundred sixty-three-c of the retirement and social security law or similar accidental disability pension provided by the pension fund of which he is a member. If application for such retirement allowance or pension is not made by such policeman, application therefor may be made by the head of the police force or as otherwise provided by the chief executive officer or local legislative body of the municipality by which such policeman is employed.”
Retirement and Social Security Law § 605, “Disability retirement,” provides in applicable part as follows:
“a. Application for a disability retirement allowance for a member may be made by:
“1. Such member, or
“2. The head of the department in which such member is employed.
“b. At the time of the filing of an application pursuant to this section, the member must:
“1. Have at least ten years of total service credit
“3. Provided, however, if the retirement system determines that such member was physically or mentally incapacitated for performance of gainful employment as the natural and proximate result of an accident not caused by his own willful negligence sustained in the performance of his duties in active service while actually a member of the retirement system the requirement that the member should have ten years of credited service shall be inapplicable.
“c. If the retirement system determines that the member is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of gainful employment, and that he was so incapacitated at the time he ceased his performance of duties and ought to be retired for disability, he shall be so retired.”
Discussion
The facts in this proceeding relating to Faltermeier’s permanent disability and his years of service are undisputed. The parties further agree that Faltermeier was injured in the performance of his duties, but do not agree that his disability was the result of an accident sustained in the performance of his duties. The Appellate Division, Third Department’s decision in Matter of De Novio v County of Schenectady (293 AD2d 101 [3d Dept 2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 607 [2002]) has a significant impact on the issue presented in this proceeding. De Novio (at 103) contains the following excerpt from General Municipal Law § 207-c:
“Payment of the full amount of regular salary or wages, as provided by subdivision one of this section, shall be discontinued with respect to any [qualified employee] who is permanently disabled as a result of an injury or sickness incurred or resulting from the performance of his duties if such [employee] is granted an accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to section three hundred sixty-three of the retirement and social security law, a retirement for disability incurred in performance of duty allowance pursuant to section three hundred sixty-three-c of the retirement and social security law or similar accidental disability pension provided by the pension fund of which he is a member (General Municipal Law § 207-c [2] [emphasis supplied]).”
As a tier IV member of the State and Local Employees’ Retirement System, respondent Faltermeier is subject only to Retirement and Social Security Law article 15, § 605 disability retirement. “In contrast to the provisions of title 8, which separately authorize ordinary disability retirement (see, Retirement and Social Security Law § 362), accidental [disability] retirement (see, Retirement and Social Security Law § 363) and performance of duty retirement (see, Retirement and Social Security Law § 363-c) . . . section 605 disability retirement encompasses all available forms of disability retirement for the members of petitioner’s retirement system.” (De Novio v County of Schenectady, supra at 104 [emphasis supplied].)
Under the facts of this proceeding, this court determines that section 605 disability retirement encompasses all available forms of disability retirement for members of respondent Faltermeier’s retirement system. “To be eligible for section 605 disability retirement, a member must either have 10 years of service [emphasis added] ... or demonstrate that his or her disability resulted from an accident sustained in the performance of his or her duties (see, Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 [b] [(1)], [3]).” (De Novio, supra at 104.) The De Novio court determined that “the clear terms of Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 provide for accidental disability retirement, for which petitioner was eligible as a tier IV member, rendering that section a logical counterpart for the benefits available to members of the Police and Fire Retirement System under Retirement and Social Security Law §§ 363 and 363-c” (De Novio, supra at 104 [emphasis supplied]).
In De Novio, the petitioner was found to be disabled as a result of an accident sustained in the performance of his duties (although he had 10 years of service in the system) — rather than as a result of being disabled with 10 years of service. The De Novio court specifically noted “That petitioner, in light of his years of service, also would have been eligible for section 605 disability retirement without proving an accident or an injury sustained in the performance of his duties does not alter our conclusion. Both the language of General Municipal Law § 207-c and the available legislative history support the conclusion that the Legislature intended a municipality’s obligation to pay full-salary benefits to be temporary, ending when the recipient became eligible for a comparable disability benefit (see, General Municipal Law § 207-c [2], [5]; Governor’s Mem approving L 1961, ch 920, 1961 McKinney’s Session Laws of NY, at 2141 [reflects the Governor’s insistence, prior to his approving the legislation, on protections designed to limit the duration of a municipality’s obligation to pay full-salary benefits]).” (Matter of De Novio v County of Schenectady, supra at 104-105 [emphasis supplied].) The De Novio court concluded that “The fact that the accidental disability benefits available to the members of petitioner’s retirement system are authorized by the same statute that provides ordinary disability benefits is an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that such benefits do not constitute an ‘accidental disability pension’ within the meaning of General Municipal Law § 207-c (2).” (Id. at 105.)
The state respondents argue that Faltermeier’s disability pension under Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (b) (1), based upon having 10 years of service without regard to whether the disability was caused by an accident during the performance of his duties, is not a “similar accidental disability pension” because there is no requirement for an accident sustained in the performance of his duties like Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (b) (3) — the basis for the petitioner’s disability pension in De Novio.
Indisputably, De Novio held that section 605 disability retirement is a similar accidental disability pension provided by the pension fund of which he is a member. Based upon the De Novio holding, the Governor’s Memorandum relating to the enactment of General Municipal Law § 207-c, and the fact that the value, form and payments of a disability pension pursuant to Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (b) (1) and (3) are exactly the same, this court hereby interprets the holding in De Novio to include disability pensions under Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (b) (1) as a “similar accidental disability pension” provided by the pension fund of which he is a member. Such a holding advances the Legislature’s intention of providing protections designed to limit the duration of a municipality’s obligation to pay full salary benefits. This court also gleans significant indication of legislative intent from the fact that General Municipal Law § 207-c (2) provides that municipalities shall cease paying full salary benefits to policemen who are permanently disabled as a result of an injury resulting from performance of their duties if such policeman is granted a retirement for disability incurred in performance of duty allowance pursuant to Retirement and Social Security Law § 363-c (a disability retirement benefit without regard to “accident”).
A holding that the exact same pensions are not a “similar accidental disability pension” (i.e., Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 [b] [1] vs. Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 [b] [3]) simply because petitioner’s eligibility was arrived at under a different set of circumstances is not logical because such a holding would create a paradox whereby a permanently disabled member who was not disabled as a result of an “accident” sustained in the performance of his or her duties would continue to receive full General Municipal Law § 207-c pay and benefits, whereas another permanently disabled member who was disabled as a result of an “accident” sustained in the performance of his or her duties would only be able to collect Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 disability retirement benefits. The Legislature never would have promoted such a result wherein deputy sheriffs who are disabled as a result of an accident while performing their duties on behalf of the public would receive a Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 disability retirement payment, whereas deputy sheriffs who are disabled as a result of a sickness or an injury incurred in or resulting from performance of their duties continue to draw their full salaries pursuant to General Muncipal Law § 207-c.
In addition, there are several Appellate Division, Third Department, holdings which essentially teach that virtually no injury to a policeman, fireman, or other retirement system member in the performance of his or her duties results from an “accident” as that word is used in Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (see, e.g., Matter of Penkalski v McCall, 292 AD2d 735 [3d Dept 2002]; Matter of Butler v McCall, 247 AD2d 709, 710 [3d Dept 1998]; Matter of O’Donnell v New York State & Local Retirement Sys., 249 AD2d 607 [3d Dept 1998]). If an injury from an “accident” in the performance of duty is interpreted as strictly and narrowly as case law suggests, then the provisions of General Municipal Law § 207-c (2) and Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 as enacted by the Legislature would be virtually useless and worthless to municipalities seeking to utilize the provisions of those sections to avoid continuing to pay full salaries and benefits under General Municipal Law § 207-c (1) UNLESS such statutes are construed consistent with this court’s determination that all forms of disability retirement under Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 are applicable to and allowable for municipal applications for disability retirement under General Municipal Law § 207-c (2).
Municipalities whose policemen are members of the Police and Fire Retirement System can apply to retire permanently disabled policemen injured in the performance of their duties without regard to “accident” (see, Retirement and Social Security Law § 363 [accidental disability retirement allowance], and § 363-c [disability incurred in performance of duty allowance]). Under the statutory interpretation advanced by respondent McCall (now Hevesi), only those municipalities whose policemen are members of the New York State and Local Employees’ Retirement System would be hamstrung by the limitation that the disability retirement benefits pursuant to General Municipal Law § 207-c (2) and Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 must result from an accident, therefore, such municipalities would be required to continue to pay General Municipal Law § 207-c (1) full salary and benefits to permanently disabled policemen injured during the performance of their duties — unless such injury resulted from an “accident.”
This court holds and determines that because disability retirement under Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (b) (1) and accidental disability retirement under Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 (b) (3) are the only disability retirement benefits for members of the New York State and Local Employees’ Retirement System, the petitioner County of Montgomery is authorized by General Municipal Law § 207-c (2) and Retirement and Social Security Law § 605 to apply for disability retirement benefits for a deputy sheriff with 10 years of service or more who is permanently disabled as a result of an injury incurred in or resulting from the performance of his duties — without regard to whether or not such permanent disability was caused by an “accident.”
Accordingly, this court holds and determines that respondent McCall’s September 6, 2002 findings of fact and conclusions of law should be and the same are hereby vacated and that Hearing Officer Lomanto’s July 30, 2002 bench decision should be and the same is hereby reinstated. This court further holds and determines that the petitioners may file for Retirement and Social Security Law article 15, § 605 disability retirement benefits for and on behalf of respondent Faltermeier.
Cross Petition
Respondent Faltermeier asserts that this proceeding should be transferred to the Appellate Division for a final determination to be made in that Court, on substantial evidence grounds. The facts in this proceeding are uncontested, and the issue presented is one of pure statutory construction. Accordingly, respondent Faltermeier’s request for a transfer to the Appellate Division on the substantial evidence question should be and the same is hereby denied. Respondent Faltermeier’s application for a judgment declaring that he receive an accidental disability retirement benefit at 75% of his final average salary should be and the same is hereby denied. The cross petition is hereby dismissed.
Conclusion
This court holds and determines that the petition should be and the same is hereby granted; that respondent McCall’s September 6, 2002 findings of fact and conclusions of law should be and the same are hereby vacated; and that Hearing Officer Lomanto’s July 30, 2002 bench decision should be and the same is hereby reinstated. This court further holds and determines that petitioners may file for Retirement and Social Security Law, article 15, § 605 disability retirement benefits for and on behalf of respondent Faltermeier.",0
0654-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Brian Hansbury, J.
Facts
On June 6, 2003, the defendant was charged by simplified traffic information with driving in excess of the maximum speed limit, a violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1180 (d). On June 20, 2003, the appearance date indicated on the simplified traffic information, the defendant and his attorney appeared at the traffic clerk’s office, pleaded not guilty by so indicating on part B of the traffic ticket, requested a supporting deposition, filed a notice of appearance, and left without appearing before a judge for arraignment. On June 27, 2003, a lieutenant in the White Plains Police Department served a supporting deposition directly upon the defendant by mailing the same to the defendant’s residence.
Arguments
The defendant moves pursuant to CPL 170.30 (1) (a) for dismissal upon the ground that failure to serve the supporting deposition on the defendant’s attorney renders the simplified traffic information insufficient on its face. In support of this contention, the defendant cites People v Rossi (154 Misc 2d 616 [Just Ct, Nassau County 1992]).
In opposition to the motion, the prosecution argues that an administrative error committed by the court clerk, which resulted in the failure to notify the police department that the defendant was represented by an attorney, should not result in the dismissal of the simplified traffic information, especially where, as here, the defendant received a timely supporting deposition and has failed to demonstrate any prejudice. Citing the case of People v Schlosser (129 Misc 2d 690 [Nassau Dist Ct 1985]), it is further argued that the court should impose upon defense counsel a requirement that a separate request for a supporting deposition be served on the prosecution.
The prosecution also relies upon People v Mensch (NYLJ, Mar. 18, 2002, at 28, col 2 [White Plains City Ct, Friia, J.]), wherein the court denied a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPL 170.30 (1) (a) holding that the defendant’s failure to comply with the plea-by-mail provision of Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1806 deprived the court of jurisdiction to entertain the application.
In his reply papers, the defendant argues that the Mensch case is inapplicable because jurisdiction over the defendant has been acquired. On this point, the defendant emphasizes that his plea of not guilty was accepted by the Deputy Chief Clerk on June 20, 2003. Implicit in the defendant’s argument is that the acceptance of a not guilty plea by the Deputy Chief Clerk is a valid substitute for a personal arraignment.
Discussion
CPL 100.25 (2) provides that a defendant charged by a simplified information is, upon a timely request, entitled as a matter of right to a supporting deposition of the complainant police officer and that upon such a request, the court must order the officer to serve a copy of the same within 30 days of the date such request is received by the court, or at least five days before trial, whichever is earlier (see People v De Feo, 77 Misc 2d 523 [App Term, 2d Dept 1974]). A failure to provide a supporting deposition in a timely manner renders the simplified traffic information defective as a matter of law and subject to dismissal (see People v Nuccio, 78 NY2d 102 [1991]; People v Aucello, 146 Misc 2d 417 [App Term, 2d Dept 1990]).
The prosecution’s contention that the defendant should be required to serve a separate request for a supporting deposition has been expressly rejected by the Appellate Term (see People v Thumser, 148 Misc 2d 472 [App Term, 2d Dept 1990]; People v Rubens, NYLJ, Feb. 16, 1990, at 26, col 4 [App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists]; see also People v Branchinelli, 146 Misc 2d 73 [Nassau Dist Ct 1989]). Under the doctrine of stare decisis, this court is bound to follow the foregoing Appellate Term holdings (see Yellow Book of NY v Dimilia, 188 Misc 2d 489 [Nassau Dist Ct 2001]; Rules of App Div, 2d Dept [22 NYCRR] § 730.1 [d] [2] [ii]; compare People v Pestana, 195 Misc 2d 833 [Crim Ct, NY County 2003]).
Nor is the court persuaded that an administrative error should exempt this case from dismissal based upon a failure to comply with CPL 100.25 (2). Dismissal based upon the noncompliance with CPL 100.25 is required when the complainant police officer is never ordered by the court to serve a supporting deposition (see People v Titus, 178 Misc 2d 687 [App Term, 2d Dept 1998]; People v Zagorsky, 73 Misc 2d 420 [Broome County Ct 1973]) and this rule of law finds no exception based upon an inadvertent mistake made by a court clerk (see People v Abajian, 142 Misc 2d 250 [Just Ct, Rockland County 1989]).
Similarly, the court finds that the alleged lack of prejudice is irrelevant on the issue of facial sufficiency. While one court has relied upon, among other things, the absence of demonstrable prejudice (see People v Chess, 149 Misc 2d 430 [Just Ct, Nassau County 1991]), this court holds that the element of prejudice has no bearing on a determination of the facial sufficiency of the simplified traffic information.
Next, in People v Rossi (154 Misc 2d 616 [Just Ct, Nassau County 1992]) it was held that where an attorney appears for the defendant, the supporting deposition must be served upon that attorney within the time prescribed by statute and that timely service upon the defendant alone is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of CPL 100.25 (2). While the decision in Rossi is not binding precedent on this court (see generally 1 CarmodyWait 2d §§ 2:273-2:286), it is persuasive and the defendant’s reliance upon that case presents a compelling argument for dismissal of the simplified traffic information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is necessary to examine whether or not the court has acquired personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
Criminal Procedure Law § 170.30 (1) states, in pertinent part, as follows: “After arraignment upon ... a simplified information[] . . . the local criminal court may, upon motion of the defendant, dismiss such instrument. . . upon the ground that: (a) It is defective, within the meaning of section 170.35 . . . .” (Emphasis added.) An arraignment is defined as “the occasion upon which a defendant against whom an accusatory instrument has been filed appears before the court in which the criminal action is pending for the purpose of having such court acquire and exercise control over his person with respect to such accusatory instrument and of setting the course of further proceedings in the action.” (CPL 1.20 [9].)
The general rule is that a defendant must personally appear in court for arraignment; however, the Legislature has provided two exceptions whereby a defendant charged by a simplified traffic information may be arraigned without a court appearance (CPL 170.10 [1] [a], [b]).
The first exception enables a defendant charged with a traffic infraction to enter a not guilty plea “by mailing to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the ticket making the charge and a signed statement indicating such plea. Such plea must be sent: (a) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested or by first class mail; and (b) within forty-eight hours after receiving such ticket.” (Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1806.) The second exception permits defense counsel to enter an appearance in lieu of defendant “for good cause shown.” (CPL 170.10 [1] [b].)
It is undisputed that on June 20, 2003 neither defendant nor his attorney appeared in court before a judge. Rather, 14 days after the issuance of the simplified traffic information, defendant and his attorney appeared at the traffic clerk’s window where the Deputy Chief Clerk accepted the defendant’s not guilty plea along with counsel’s notice of appearance. Clearly this procedure does not fall within either of the foregoing exceptions to the general rule that a defendant must appear in person for an arraignment.
While the Deputy Chief Clerk has the power to administer oaths, take acknowledgments and sign the process or mandate of the court (UCCA 105 [a]; Uniform Rules for City Cts [22 NYCRR] § 210.43), there was no statutory authority and/or rule which enabled the Deputy Chief Clerk to accept the defendant’s plea of not guilty as a substitute for a personal arraignment {see People v Maran, 174 Misc 2d 327 [App Term, 2d Dept 1997]), and any reliance upon this act as a basis for personal jurisdiction is without basis in law.
Conclusion
In accord with the above analysis, the court holds that defendant has not been arraigned on the simplified traffic information and, as such, jurisdiction over the defendant has not been acquired (see People v Grant, 16 NY2d 722 [1965]; People v Mensch, NYLJ, Mar. 18, 2002, at 28, col 2 [White Plains City Ct]). Accordingly, the defendant’s motion pursuant to CPL 170.30 (1) (a) is denied as premature (see People v Marzban, 172 Misc 2d 987 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1997]; People v New York Paving, 155 Misc 2d 176 [Crim Ct, Queens County 1992]; People v Byfield, 131 Misc 2d 884 [Crim Ct, NY County 1986]).
Having failed to satisfy the statutory framework set forth above, the defendant shall be required to appear in person before a judge for arraignment on the simplified traffic information (see People v DeLuca, 166 Misc 2d 313 [Yonkers City Ct 1995]).

Memorandum.
Order affirmed without costs.
The entitlement to a brokerage commission is generally not conditioned upon the performance of a contract for the sale of real estate, although the parties may provide otherwise by agreement (see Levy v Lacey, 22 NY2d 271 [1968]). If, however, there is no agreement indicating when the commission is earned, such commission will be considered to have been earned upon the procurement of a purchaser who is not only ready and willing to perform the contract on terms satisfactory to the seller (see Lane-Real Estate Dept. Store v Lawlet Corp., 28 NY2d 36, 42 [1971]), but who is able to do so as well (see Rusciano Realty Servs. v Griffler, 62 NY2d 696 [1984]). An “able” purchaser is one who has the financial ability to perform. The burden lies with the broker to establish that its prospective purchaser was financially able to meet the purchase price (see O’Connor Realty v Higgins, 149 AD2d 492 [1989]).
In this action, defendant sellers made a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment by submitting documentation indicating that the purchasers were unable to obtain a mortgage commitment in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale. This demonstrated that the prospective purchasers were not ready, willing and able to complete the transaction.
In view of the foregoing, it was incumbent on plaintiff real estate brokers to come forward with evidence in admissible form showing that either an issue of fact existed as to the purchasers’ ability to complete the transaction or that the purchasers were in fact ready, willing and able to purchase the property. Plaintiffs failed to proffer any evidentiary proof in admissible form to demonstrate the purchasers’ financial ability to perform the contract. We note that “[i]t is not necessary to follow a particular formula in order to establish financial ability of a prospective purchaser to meet the price, but there must be some tangible evidence from which a jury could conclude that he would have had the ability” (Globerman v Lederer, 281 App Div 39, 42-43 [1952]).
Accordingly, the court below properly granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, and properly denied the plaintiffs’ cross motion.
Patterson, J., dissents and votes to modify the order by denying defendants’ motion and plaintiffs’ cross motion for summary judgment without prejudice to renewal following completion of discovery in the following memorandum: While I do not disagree with the opinion of the majority that plaintiff brokers failed to come forward with sufficient proof to raise an issue of fact in opposition to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, it is my opinion that the circumstances of this case suggest that a summary adjudication is premature pending the parties’ completion of discovery.
It is uncontroverted that approximately one week following the execution of the contract of sale, the attorney for the sellers attempted to return the down payment to the purchasers, claiming that the contract had been signed and sent to them in error, and that no contract existed. Despite a request that the sellers provide the purchasers’ attorney with written assurances that they intended to proceed with their obligations under the contract, the sellers did not do so, and continued to insist that there was no binding and enforceable contract until and through the expiration of the time within which the purchasers were required to obtain a firm mortgage commitment, when the sellers were able to take advantage of the mortgage contingency clause as a basis for cancelling the contract. Although the purchasers notified the sellers that they considered the sellers’ failure to provide them with written assurances as a breach of the contract, approximately one week later, the purchasers acknowledged the cancellation of the contract, accepted return of the down payment, and, in exchange for the payment of $2,500, executed a release in favor of the sellers (presumably in settlement of any dispute arising out of the sale of the house).
CPLR 3212 (f) authorizes a court to deny a motion for summary judgment or to order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or disclosure to be had, should it appear that facts essential to justify opposition to the motion may exist but cannot then be stated. Where it is apparent from the affidavits submitted by a party that discovery is necessary, that party should be given a reasonable opportunity for disclosure prior to determination of the summary judgment motion (see Urcan v Cocarelli, 234 AD2d 537 [1996]).
In this case, plaintiffs are at an obvious disadvantage in that most of the documentation which might support their position is not within their control. In addition, it appears that at the time that defendants’ motion for summary judgment was made, party depositions had not even been held. Since virtually no pretrial discovery had been conducted such as might yield information which would permit plaintiffs to raise issues of fact in opposition, in my view, the lower court should have denied summary judgment with leave to renew upon completion of discovery. .

Memorandum.
Order insofar as appealed from unanimously reversed without costs, plaintiffs motion for summary judgment in the sum of $5,226.76 together with reasonable attorney’s fees is granted and matter remanded to the court below for a determination of said fees.
The documentary evidence submitted upon plaintiffs motion for summary judgment established that defendants entered into a finance lease with plaintiff in accordance with article 2-A of the Uniform Commercial Code. The corporate defendant (with the individual defendant acting as guarantor) opted to lease a computer software program provided by a supplier of its own choosing. As a result, defendants were obligated to honor the terms of the lease agreement with plaintiff irrespective of any difficulties with the program or its supplier. Inasmuch as it is uncontroverted that defendants failed to make the required payment, plaintiff is entitled to recover the damages as set forth in the finance lease (see generally UCC 2-A-103 [1] [g]; 2-A-209, 2-A-407; see also General Elec.

Jane S. Solomon, J.
In this case arising from a slip and fall alleged to have occurred on January 14, 1992, the court is faced with an anomaly in the CPLR which appears to compel an absurd result that rewards recalcitrant lawyers for neglecting their clients and ignoring orders of this court. Accordingly, plaintiffs motion to vacate the dismissal of her claim, and to give her an opportunity to file a note of issue, is granted, and the cross motion to dismiss her lawsuits as abandoned is denied.
Plaintiff sued defendant New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) in September 1992, purchasing index number 27553/ 1992. A summons and complaint was served on NYCHA in October 1992. The summons did not have an index number on it. Arguably, the summons was defective, but nevertheless NYCHA answered the summons and complaint and served discovery demands, also without any index number appearing in the caption.
In October 1992, NYCHA obtained a second index number (45041/1992), filed a request for judicial intervention (RJI) under that number, and moved to dismiss the complaint based on plaintiffs refusal to submit to a preaction medical examination as required under Public Housing Law § 157 (2) and General Municipal Law § 50-h. The case was assigned to Justice Burton Sherman of this court, who denied the motion to dismiss but directed that plaintiff submit to a physical examination. The case then proceeded for approximately four years under index number 45041/1992.
A preliminary conference was held before Justice Sherman on June 18, 1993. At that conference, Justice Sherman ordered that plaintiff file a note of issue no later than May 31, 1994. The preliminary conference order, which is the standard carbon copy form used by the Supreme Court in New York County, and which is usually filled out by the attorneys for the judge to review, bears the index number 27553/1992. Plaintiff did not file the note of issue within the time established in that order.
On October 13, 1994, plaintiff served a copy of a note of issue and statement of readiness on defendant, which prompted defendant to move to strike the note of issue and remove the case from the trial calendar because plaintiff had failed to provide discovery as required in the preliminary conference order. However, the court’s records show that plaintiff did not file a note of issue, and the matter was not put on the trial calendar. Defendant’s motion was withdrawn.
By an order dated June 16, 1995, Justice Lehner of this court decided a plaintiffs motion for more time by approving the parties’ stipulation which, among other things, extended plaintiff s time to file a note of issue to December 31, 1995. Again, plaintiff did not file the note of issue. By an order dated June 10, 1996, Justice Lehner further extended plaintiffs time to file a note of issue to September 30, 1996. Again, plaintiff did not file the note of issue. By an order dated November 18, 1996, Justice Lehner directed that “note of issue must be filed by 3/18/97. If not parties to appear for conf. on 3/18/97 9:30” (emphasis in original). Yet again, plaintiff did not file the note of issue, and counsel failed to appear at the March 18, 1997 conference. Defendants claim that Justice Lehner dismissed the action that morning, and although no written order dismissing the action is produced on this motion, the court’s computer records indicate that the action was disposed on March 18, 1997. It is not clear from the record what happened on that day.
NYCHA never served upon plaintiff a demand pursuant to CPLR 3216 that she serve and file a note of issue within 90 days. Indeed, when plaintiff served (but did not file) a note of issue, NYCHA moved to vacate it because discovery was not complete.
In April 1998, plaintiff made a motion, under index number 27553/92, to place the action on the trial calendar. The motion was “bounced” by the clerk’s office, presumably because it was made under an index number for which no RJI had been filed. NYCHA’s lawyer then sent a letter to plaintiffs lawyer, dated April 29, 1998, stating that the action was dismissed, and that it was marked “disposed” in the records kept in the clerk’s office. Plaintiffs counsel did not respond to this letter, and apparently did nothing more to advance her claim until the present motion, submitted more than six years after the action was marked disposed in the public and now Internet-available court record.
The present motion initially was made on January 16, 2003. Plaintiff filed a request for judicial intervention under this index number on that date, which caused this case to be marked in the clerk’s records as “active” for the first time.
While the explanation for the delay in prosecuting this action proffered by plaintiffs attorney is not clear, it appears that his reason for failing to do anything for more than six years, after five years of failing to provide even basic discovery, is that he was confused about under which index number he should make the motion. This excuse is patently inadequate and frivolous, and if a reasonable excuse were required to restore the action, the action would not be restored.
NYCHA argues that the motion should be denied because plaintiff has not demonstrated (1) that she lacked the intent to abandon the claim (such intent is evidenced by her failure to respond either to the clerk’s office’s refusal to accept her motion in April 1998, or to the letter of NYCHA’s attorney notifying her attorney that the matter was dismissed), (2) that she has a reasonable excuse for the delay, (3) that she has a meritorious cause of action, and (4) lack of prejudice to NYCHA. (Kisch v St. Vincent’s Hosp. & Med. Ctr. of N.Y., 279 AD2d 341 [1st Dept 2001] [action restored after being struck from trial calendar pursuant to CPLR 3404].) With respect to prejudice, NYCHA claims that plaintiff still has not provided routine discovery material that she was required to produce more than 10 years ago. Obtaining a full medical record may be impossible because New York State requires medical providers to keep records for only six years. (Education Law § 6530 [32].) Other evidence, including the recollections of witnesses, also may have deteriorated or become unavailable.
NYCHA also argues that the action was automatically dismissed under CPLR 3404, which provides that a case marked struck from the calendar and not restored within one year shall be deemed abandoned and shall be dismissed. Under CPLR 3402 (a), the clerk is directed to “enter the case upon the calendar as of the date of the filing of the note of issue.” The calendar referred to in CPLR 3404 is clearly the trial calendar, and therefore that rule is inapplicable to this case.
Finally, NYCHA argues that Justice Lehner was authorized to enter an order dismissing the case when plaintiff failed to appear for the March 18, 1997 conference. The Uniform Rules for Trial Courts (Uniform Rules) provide at (22 NYCRR) § 202.27 that
“At any scheduled call of a calendar or at any conference, if all parties do not appear . . . the judge may note the default on the record and enter an order as follows . . .
“(b) If the defendant appears but the plaintiff does not, the judge may dismiss the action . . . .”
The difficulty with this argument is that there is no record that the judge entered an order on the day of the conference. The issue on this motion is not what could have been done when plaintiff failed to appear for a conference, but what must be done now that she seeks to revive her case. Moreover, to the limited extent that Uniform Rules (22 NYCRR) § 202.27 conflicts with the CPLR, the conflict should be resolved in favor of the legislatively enacted CPLR.
In opposing NYCHA’s cross motion, plaintiff takes a new approach. Her lawyers argue that because they (repeatedly) disobeyed Justice Sherman’s and Justice Lehner’s orders to file a note of issue, their failure to appear at a conference as directed by the judge and to prosecute the matter in any way for years on end is entirely excusable under CPLR 3216. And they are correct.
Under CPLR 3216, no dismissal shall be directed where a party unreasonably neglects to proceed in an action unless the court or party seeking to dismiss the action has served a written demand by registered or certified mail requiring the neglectful party to serve and file a note of issue within 90 days after receipt of such demand. (CPLR 3216 [b] [3].) In Chase v Scavuzzo, the Court of Appeals held that the courts do not possess the power to dismiss an action for general delay where plaintiff has not been served with a 90-day demand to serve and file a note of issue. (87 NY2d 228, 233 [1995].) “Thus, the inherent ‘power and practice of the courts in controlling the flow of litigation by dismissing neglected actions’ has been abrogated by statute.” (Arcate v Cohen, 289 AD2d 148, 149 [1st Dept 2001] [citations omitted]; see Cohn v Borchard Affiliations, 25 NY2d 237 [1969] [reversing the Appellate Division, First Department’s determination that CPLR 3216 unconstitutionally interfered with a court’s inherent power to dismiss a complaint for failure to prosecute].) Absent the 90-day notice, a neglectful and contumacious plaintiff’s lawyer is not only relieved of the burden of showing that the claim has any merit, or even that a reasonable excuse exists for failing to prosecute an action for years after it was dismissed by a justice of this court, the lawyer is in fact rewarded for that conduct.
Defendant is not blameless because it did not serve a 90-day demand upon plaintiff by registered or certified mail. Its argues that plaintiff received warnings from the prior judges to file the note of issue or risk dismissal, and further that the action is not, and never was, ready to be placed on the trial calendar because plaintiff did not provide basic discovery. The paradox of the scheme under CPLR 3216 is that the only way for a defendant to obtain the dismissal of an abandoned case where plaintiff has not complied with discovery orders, and the case is far from trial-ready, is to demand that plaintiff file and serve a false certificate of readiness and note of issue.
In an effort to assert some authority over prenote of issue case management, the administrators of the New York State Supreme Court established standards and goals for the length of time expected to be consumed with litigation steps, including discovery, from the filing of an RJI to the note of issue. The court’s administration collects statistics regarding how well “standards and goals” are met, and periodically the justices are cajoled to apply themselves more rigorously in this endeavor, although the resulting orders are honored (or not) depending on counsels’ enthusiasm for case disposition. Lacking in the CPLR or standards and goals rules, as demonstrated by the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals in the decisions cited herein (and many others), is a grant of authority to the justices of this court to enforce compliance in an action in which the RJI was filed nearly 12 years ago, never mind 12 months. By contrast, a judge of the United States District Court is empowered under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to enforce its case management orders with sanctions, including the power to dismiss an action where a party (or its attorney) fails to obey a scheduling order or to appear at a scheduling or pretrial conference. (See, Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 16 [f]; rule 37 [b] [2] [B], [C], [D].)
Under the CPLR, however, New York State courts are denied the power to enforce scheduling orders made before the note of issue is filed. In light of the interpretation of CPLR 3216 by the Court of Appeals and the Appellate Division, the court is compelled to reinstate this long-dead action.
Neither CPLR 3216, nor the judicial decisions interpreting it, provide the court with any discretion to consider whether the opposing party would be unduly prejudiced by the delay. The issues raised by NYCHA regarding plaintiffs failure to provide discovery and prejudice it has suffered as a result of the delay can be addressed at the pretrial conference, or through motions in limine.
Just as plaintiffs lawyer offers no reasonable excuse for failing to prosecute this action, the argument that this action was never dismissed because counsel was confused over what index number to use is preposterous. Plaintiffs request to consolidate the actions is granted, however, in order to remove the administrative hurdle resulting from both parties’ failure to properly caption their papers.
Accordingly, it hereby is ordered that plaintiffs motion to “restore” the action and to allow her time to file a note of issue is granted; and it further is ordered that NYCHA’s cross motion to dismiss is denied; and it further is ordered that plaintiffs motion to consolidate this action with the action under index number 45041/1992 is granted, and the two actions are consolidated under index number 27553/1992; and it further is ordered that the pleadings in the actions hereby consolidated shall stand as the pleadings in the consolidated action.
. This may be because this court believes that the trial support office habitually refuses to accept a note of issue filed beyond the date set in the preliminary conference order form and entered into the computer.
. Under Uniform Rules (22 NYCRR) § 202.21, a note of issue must be accompanied by a certificate of readiness.",0

Memorandum.
Judgment of conviction unanimously modified on the law by reversing defendant’s conviction of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law § 240.30 [2]) and dismissing that part of the accusatory instrument charging him with said crime; as so modified, affirmed.
On appeal, defendant raises issues regarding the sufficiency of the accusatory instrument, insofar as it charged him with aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law § 240.30 [2]), and the trial court’s charge to the jury. A person is guilty of violating Penal Law § 240.30 (2) when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he or she “[mjakes a telephone call, whether or not a conversation ensues, with no purpose of legitimate communication.” While the Court of Appeals, in People v Casey (95 NY2d 354 [2000]), found that hearsay pleading defects of an information are waivable, it did not dilute the statutory requirement that the allegations of the factual part of the information, and/or any supporting depositions, establish, if true, every element of the offense(s) charged and the defendant’s commission thereof (see CPL 100.40 [1]).
An element of Penal Law § 240.30 (2) is that the telephone call had “no purpose of legitimate communication” (see People v Shack, 86 NY2d 529, 539 [1995]), and the mere recitation, in the accusatory instrument, of defendant’s threat to the complainants does not establish such element. This is so, notwithstanding the fact that a determination that a telephone call had “no purpose of legitimate communication” may involve subjective analysis (see e.g. Shack, 86 NY2d at 538). Accordingly, inasmuch as the failure to allege the foregoing in the accusatory instrument is a nonwaivable jurisdictional defect (see People v Alejandro, 70 NY2d 133, 135-136 [1987]), that part of the judgment convicting defendant of aggravated harassment in the second degree is reversed and the count of the accusatory instrument relating to said charge is dismissed.
Defendant’s remaining contentions lack merit or are unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05).

John M. Leventhae, J.
This decision explains the court’s ruling during trial that neither the People nor the defendant were entitled to a missing witness instruction as to the complainant.
On February 2, 2002, the defendant stabbed her boyfriend in the neck with a knife. The defendant and her boyfriend are the only witnesses to the incident. For this incident the defendant was indicted for assault in the first and second degrees.
Prior to trial, both parties submitted a witness list. The defendant’s boyfriend’s/complainant’s name did not appear on either the prosecutor’s or the defendant’s witness trial list. Defense counsel informed the court and the prosecution that he would be seeking a missing witness instruction to the jury should the complainant not be called to testify at trial for the People. Defense counsel also requested that he be allowed to comment on the boyfriend’s failure to testify during summation. The People opposed the defendant’s application and informed the court and defense counsel that they would request a missing witness charge be given to the jury against the defendant should she fail to call her boyfriend as a witness at trial.
The People’s proof at trial consisted of an admission given by the defendant in a 911 tape that she had stabbed her boyfriend in the neck. This was admitted as an excited utterance (see People v Vasquez, 88 NY2d 561 [1996]; People v Brown, 70 NY2d 513 [1987]). Additionally, the defendant had given a videotaped statement to the authorities where she related that she had stabbed her boyfriend. During these statements, the defendant also said that her boyfriend had been hitting her immediately prior to and when she stabbed him. The boyfriend, while under the stress of his wounds, stated at the scene of the incident that the defendant had stabbed him. This too was admitted at trial as an excited utterance. (People v Edwards, 47 NY2d 493, 496-497 [1979].)
The defendant testified that she stabbed the victim because he was beating her. The defendant claimed justification. The defendant also testified that her boyfriend was afraid to come to court because of his immigration status.
Neither the defendant nor the People called the complainant to testify.
At oral argument on the requests for a missing witness instruction, the defendant admitted that the complainant was living with her. It was established that the victim and the defendant have parented a child together (currently six months old). The prosecutor produced complainant’s written statement dated February 26, 2002 given to him by defense counsel months earlier. The complainant therein admitted to slapping defendant on occasions prior to the incident of February 2, 2002 and perhaps immediately prior to the stabbing. The complainant clearly admitted to shoving defendant prior to the stabbing. The complainant averred, “I believe if I had not been physically abusive — this incident would not have happened. I still love her. I did tell the District Attorney that I did not want to pursue this matter — the D.A. stated I had no choice and I could not drop the charges.”
The court ruled that a missing witness instruction would not be given against either party.
After trial the defendant was convicted of assault in the second degree.
Missing Witness Instruction
“The ‘missing witness’ instruction allows a jury to draw an unfavorable inference based on a party’s failure to call a witness who would normally be expected to support that party’s version of events (see, 1 CJI[NY] 8.55, at 451-453).” (People v Savinon, 100 NY2d 192, 196 [2003].) Three preconditions must be present in order for a court to give a missing witness charge to a jury: (1) the witness’s knowledge must be material to the trial; (2) the witness must be expected to give noncumulative testimony favorable to the party against whom the charge is sought (the “control” factor); and (3) the witness must be available to that party. (People v Gonzalez, 68 NY2d 424, 427 [1986]; Graves v United States, 150 US 118, 121 [1893]; see also Prince, Richardson on Evidence § 3-140 [Farrell 11th ed].)
“Control” is a term of art without exactitude. “[Although not susceptible of precise definition,” it is a relative concept concerning “the relationship between the witness and the parties” (Gonzalez, 68 NY2d at 429). Control means favorable “to or under the influence of one party and hostile to the other” (id. at 429; Prince, Richardson on Evidence § 3-140 [Farrell 11th ed]). “ ‘[A]vailability’ of a witness is a separate consideration from that of ‘control’. ‘Availability’ simply refers to the party’s ability to produce such witness” (id. at 428). It is related to the physical whereabouts of the witness, a fact that the party claiming unavailability must be permitted to establish (Prince, Richardson on Evidence, op. cit., § 3-140; People v Vasquez, 76 NY2d 722 [1990]).
Instruction against the People
A complainant in a criminal case is generally considered to be under the control of the People and would tend to give testimony favorable to the prosecution. When there are allegations of domestic violence and where the defendant and the complainant continue or resume their intimate relationship, the issue of whether the complainant is under the control and/or available to the People is different.
The Appellate Division has affirmed the denial of a missing witness charge against the People where the crimes involved domestic violence. In People v Congilaro (159 AD2d 964, 965 [1990]) the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, upheld a trial court’s denial of defendant’s request for a missing witness charge when the defendant’s girlfriend failed to testify at trial. The Court stated:
“Since defendant’s girlfriend, after providing testimony favorable to the People before the Grand Jury, recanted that testimony and provided defense counsel with a statement that exculpated defendant, the trial court properly denied defendant’s request for a missing witness charge because she could not reasonably be expected to testify in the People’s favor.” (Accord, People v Vigliotti, 270 AD2d 904 [2000] .)
In People v Hernandez (256 AD2d 18 [1998]) the Appellate Division, First Department, in a domestic violence case, upheld the trial court’s rejection of the defendant’s request for a missing witness charge concerning the complainant. The Court opined (at 19):
“[T]he defendant’s former domestic partner . . . ‘was unavailable based upon her refusal to testify . . . and was not under the control of the People such that she could be expected to give testimony favorable to the prosecution’ (People v Rivera, 234 AD2d 19, 20, lv denied 89 NY2d 1040). The circumstances, including defense counsel’s conversation with the victim, in which she expressed hostility to the prosecution and refusal to testify, establish that the victim was, if anything, ‘favorable to or under the influence of [defendant] and hostile to the [People]’ (People v Gonzalez, 68 NY2d 424, 429), rather than the other way around. By the time of trial, the victim had, at the very least, ceased to be in ‘a pragmatic sense unavailable to [defendant].’ ” (Citations omitted; see also People v Keen, 94 NY2d 533 [2000].)
In the matter sub judice, the boyfriend provided defense counsel with a statement that he may have hit the defendant prior to the stabbing and that he wanted to drop the charges. The content of the statement clearly indicated that the boyfriend did not want to testify on the People’s behalf (Congilaro, 159 AD2d at 965). The complainant resided at defendant’s residence. The defendant testified that the victim would not testify in court out of fear of the immigration factors (Hernandez, 256 AD2d at 19).
The court notes parenthetically, however, that the People did not exercise the due diligence required to demonstrate the unavailability of the boyfriend. A court may not rely on a party’s representation alone that a witness is unavailable (see Savinon, 100 NY2d 192 [2003]; People v Macana, 84 NY2d 173 [1994]). A subpoena, a material witness order or other diligent efforts ought to have been attempted.
Instruction against the Defendant
Although a defendant has no burden to come forward with evidence to prove or to disprove anything, once a defendant does so, the failure to call an available witness could be brought to the jury’s attention if such witness’s testimony would be favorable to the defendant and hostile to the prosecution (People v Rodriguez, 38 NY2d 95 [1975]).
Courts have held that when a defendant’s relatives have material testimony to offer, but fail to testify on defendant’s behalf, a missing witness instruction is appropriate (People v Keen, 94 NY2d 533, 540 [2000]; People v Wilson, 64 NY2d 634 [1984]; People v Rodriguez, 38 NY2d 95 [1975]; People v Tankleff, 84 NY2d 992 [1994]; People v Macana, 84 NY2d 173 [1994]).
The boyfriend’s status as a complainant would infer that he would provide testimony favorable to the prosecution’s version of the events (see Gonzalez, 68 NY2d 424 [1986]; People v Robertson, 205 AD2d 243, 246 [1994]). The family and living relationship between the defendant and her boyfriend indicate control by the defendant.
Decision
The court held that the victim was equally available to both parties, and therefore a missing witness instruction to the jury was inappropriate (Gonzalez, 68 NY2d 424). Further the complainant’s fear caused by his immigration status rendered him unavailable.
Summations
The rules relating to the propriety of comment during summation about a missing witness is different than those relating to a missing witness charge. A comment during summation may be appropriate even where a court denies a request for a missing witness charge (People v Wood, 245 AD2d 200, 201 [1997]; People v Rios, 223 AD2d 390, 393 [1996]).
Defense counsel’s request to comment during summation about the failure of the People to call the complainant boyfriend is granted to the following extent. The defense counsel may comment on the People’s failure to call the boyfriend (see, People v Tankleff, 84 NY2d 992 [1994]). If the defense counsel should comment on this issue during summation, then the prosecutor in his summation would be able to note to the jury the boyfriend’s living and familial relationship with the defendant as well as his immigration issues. If defense counsel elects not to remark on the boyfriend’s failure to testify, then the People may not raise any of these arguments to the jury.
. There are subtle but significant differences in the Criminal Jury Instructions between a missing witness charge against the People as against the defendant. (See People v Savinon, 100 NY2d 192 [2003]; People v Paylor, 70 NY2d 146 [1987]; compare, 1 CJI[NY] 8.54, with 1 CJI[NY] 8.55.)
. In Vigliotti, the victim also left the state after service of a subpoena, which rendered him unavailable to the People and established that he was not under their control.
. Provided of course the witness’s testimony would not be cumulative (see also People v Wilson, 64 NY2d 634 [1984]).",0
0299-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Gloria M. Dabiri, J.
In these proceedings brought pursuant to article 16 of the Election Law, (1) petitioner candidate Tony Eisenberg under Index No. 26884/03 seeks to declare valid the designating petition purporting to designate him as a candidate in the September 9, 2003 Democratic Party primary election for the public office of Member of the New York City Council from the 47th Council District for the term of office which commences January 1, 2004, and to have his name restored to the ballot, and (2) respondents citizen objectors under Index No. 26896/03 (petitioners-objectors) seek to declare invalid the designating petition on the ground that petitioner is ineligible to be a candidate as designated in his petition because he was not a registered and enrolled voter and did not in fact reside at the address set forth in the designating petition. These proceedings were joined for trial which commenced on August 11 and continued on August 14 and August 18, 2003.
Discussion
On July 31, 2003, the Commissioners of the Board of Elections determined the designating petition to be invalid on the ground that, absent a court order evidencing a name change from “Anatoly Eyzenberg” to “Tony Eisenberg,” the person “Tony Eisenberg” is neither a registered nor an enrolled Democrat and, thus, the designating petition of “Tony Eisenberg” should be declared void “ab initio.” Petitioner challenges the Board’s determination and seeks to declare valid his designating petition. Respondents argue, inter alia, that petitioner was not a bona fide resident of 621 Brighton Beach Avenue, the address set forth as his residence in the designating petition, and that petitioner “Tony Eisenberg” was not registered as a Democrat under that name. The court will first address petitioner’s purported name change from “Anatoly Eyzenberg” to “Tony Eisenberg.”
Common-Law Name Change
The testimony presented at trial revealed that Anatoly Eyzenberg was petitioner’s given name at birth and the name under which he emigrated to the United States from Russia in 1980. Petitioner testified that he operated a meat business in Brighton Beach since approximately 1984 and that over the years he has come to be known, in connection with that business, as “Tony” which, he testified, is an American nickname for Anatoly. He further stated that he believes that he was discriminated against in the early years of his business because he was from Russia and that this affected his ability to obtain credit for his business.
Petitioner testified that, on June 2, 2003, he went to the Brooklyn Board of Elections and presented a voter registration application form in which he utilized the name “Tony” as his first name and changed the spelling of his last name from “Eyzenberg” to “Eisenberg.” This application is date stamped as having been received by the Board on June 2, 2003. Petitioner testified that he decided to change his name on his voter registration in contemplation of his run for City Council, in order to appear more American and to reduce the likelihood that he would be discriminated against by voters because of his Russian name. Several days later, petitioner received a form letter from the Brooklyn Board of Elections informing him that his application could not be processed because the Board had not received a copy of a court order changing his name.
Mr. Steven Richman, counsel to the New York City Board of Elections, testified that he received correspondence from Ms. Diane Rudiano, Chief of the Brooklyn Board of Elections, seeking clarification of the Board’s policy with regard to voter registration applications in which a male was seeking to change his name. The testimony revealed that the Board’s policy and procedure had been to automatically approve a change of name request made by a female (such as occurs in the event of marriage or divorce) but to require the submission of a court order in order to process a male’s change of name. At Ms. Rudiano’s request, Mr. Richman researched the rules and policies of both the New York City and New York State Boards of Elections and found no support for this position. On July 1, 2003, the Board considered the issue and determined that the Board would process any name change application unless there was evidence of fraudulent intent.
Mr. Richman testified that this policy was conveyed to the Borough Chiefs on or about July 7, 2003. Accordingly, on July 21, 2003 the Brooklyn Board of Elections office changed Mr. Eyzenberg’s voter registration information in the Board’s database to reflect his registration under the name “Tony Eisenberg.”
On June 3, 2003, Mr. Eyzenberg began circulating designating petitions for the office of City Council Member from the 47th Council District bearing the name “Tony Eisenberg.” He delivered his completed petition volume to the Board of Elections on July 10, 2003. On July 14, the respondents-objectors filed general objections to petitioner’s designating petition, and on July 21, 2003 they filed specifications for those objections.
Mr. Richman testified that Board of Elections clerks reviewed the Eisenberg petition and referred 10 specifications of objections to the Board for review. On July 31, 2003, the Board reviewed these objections and ruled them “As Stated,” that is, the objections were sustained. The Board, in essence, reversed its July 1, 2003 policy determination, concluded that a court order would be required before any name change on a voter registration and enrollment would be accepted, and voided petitioner’s registration nunc pro tunc. Thus, as there was no person registered and enrolled under the name of “Tony Eisenberg,” the designating petition was deemed invalid.
Under the common law, a person may change his or her name at will absent fraud, misrepresentation or interference with the rights of others (see Smith v United States Cas. Co., 197 NY 420, 423; Matter of Halligan, 46 AD2d 170 [1974]; see Matter of Bobrowich, 2003 NY Slip Op 50025[U] [Civ Ct, Richmond County 2003]; Matter of Conde, 186 Misc 2d 785 [Civ Ct, Kings County 2000]; Matter of Linda Ann A., 126 Misc 2d 43 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1984]; Matter of Middleton, 60 Misc 2d 1056, 1057 [Civ Ct, NY County 1969]; Matter of Sakaris, 160 Misc 2d 657 [Civ Ct, Richmond County 1993]). No judicial proceeding is necessary to change a name; it can be made effective through consistent usage or habit (see Matter of Halligan, 46 AD2d 170 [1974]; see also Matter of Ellerby, 99 Misc 2d 691 [Civ Ct 1979]). Thus “anybody may change their names without asking the approval of the court at any time and, provided fraud was not the inspiration for the act, the new name will be as effectively assumed and recognized as if its use had been provided for by a court order” (Matter of Lipschutz, 178 Misc 113, 113-114 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1941; Smith, 197 NY 420 [1910]).
In addition to the common law, New York has enacted a statutory procedure under the Civil Rights Law enabling a person to petition for a court order changing his or her name (Civil Rights Law § 60 et seq.). New York Civil Rights Law § 60 et seq. provides the necessary directions for effectuating a court ordered name change as an alternative to one’s common-law use of a name. These statutory provisions are an alternative procedure to the one under the common law; they neither diminish nor abrogate a person’s common-law right to effectuate a name change (see Matter of Ellerby, 99 Misc 2d 691 [Civ Ct, Kings County 1979]; Matter of Linda Ann A., 126 Misc 2d 43 [1984]; Matter of Sakaris, 160 Misc 2d 657 [Civ Ct 1993]). The statutory procedure differs only in the speed and certainty of the change (Civil Rights Law § 64; Matter of Halligan, 46 AD2d at 171). “Primarily, the court is charged with examining whether the name sought to be assumed will be a source of or instrumentality for fraud, evasion or interference with the rights of others” (Matter of Thompson, 82 Misc 2d 460, 461 [1975]; see also Matter of Stempler, 110 Misc 2d 174, 175 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1981]; Matter of Middleton, 60 Misc 2d 1056 [Civ Ct 1969]).
At trial petitioner testified that he changed his name from “Anatoly Eyzenberg” to “Tony Eisenberg” before deciding to run for the City Council because he feared being discriminated against based on the Russian- spelling of his name. Petitioner described the change as “Americanizing his name.”
However, the record is devoid of evidence that Mr. Eyzenberg meets the relatively simple requirement for effectuating a common-law change of name through custom and usage in his community (Smith v United States Cas. Co., 197 NY 420, 428 [1910]). In fact, petitioner concedes that he never used the name “Tony Eisenberg” on any document, such as a mortgage or lease, and that his voter registration application, submitted to the Board of Elections on June 2, 2003, was the first time that he had ever identified himself as “Tony Eisenberg.” Moreover, all of the documents produced via subpoena, including his passport, driver’s license, tax returns and various mortgages, list his name as “Anatoly Eyzenberg.” Accordingly, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he has, in fact, effectuated a common-law name change. Consequently, the designating petition designating “Tony Eisenberg” as a candidate for City Council in the 47th Council District is void and petitioner’s validating petition is denied.
Assuming arguendo that the petitioner had properly effectuated a common-law name change, his designating petition, nonetheless, would be declared invalid based upon the evidence presented by respondents on the issue of petitioner’s residency.
Residency
Respondents contend that the address contained in the designating petition, to wit: 621 Brighton Beach Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, is not petitioner’s true residence, but was inserted therein to mislead the signers of the designating petitions and hence constituted a fraud upon electors in that district.
Election Law § 6-132 (1) requires a candidate to state his or her place of residence on the designating petition. Election Law § 1-104 (22) defines “residence” as “that place where a person maintains a fixed, permanent and principal home and to which he [or she], wherever temporarily located, always intends to return” (see Camardi v Sinawski, 297 AD2d 357 [2002]). Under the Election Law, residence and domicile are treated as one and the same (see Matter of Isabella v Hotaling, 207 AD2d 648, 650 [1994], lv denied 84 NY2d 801 [1994]; Matter of Markowitz v Gumbs, 122 AD2d 906 [1986]). Additionally, a candidate who has two residences “may choose one to which [he or] she has legitimate, significant and continuing attachments as [his or] her residence for purposes of the Election Law” (Matter of Ferguson v McNab, 60 NY2d 598, 600 [1983]; People v O’Hara, 96 NY2d 378, 385 [2001]; Geller v Lasher, 196 AD2d 613 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 654 [1993]). To be a resident of a place, a person must be physically present with the intent to remain for a time (see Matter of Palla v Suffolk County Bd. of Elections, 31 NY2d 36, 47 [1972]; see also Williams v Salerno, 792 F2d 323, 327 [1986] [2d Cir]).
Thus, the issue presented herein is not whether petitioner may have two residences, or whether, as between his two residences, he picked the more appropriate one from which to register to vote. Rather, the issue is whether petitioner genuinely took up residence at the 621 Brighton Beach Avenue address, thus making it a bona fide residence from which he could vote (People v O’Hara, 96 NY2d 378, 385 [2001]).
Whether a particular residence complies with the requirements of the Election Law is determined by the individual’s manifest intent, coupled with physical presence “without any aura of sham” (People v O’Hara, 96 NY2d 378, 385 [2001], quoting Matter of Gallagher v Dinkins, 41 AD2d 946, 947 [1973]; Thompson v Karben, 295 AD2d 438, 439 [2002]). The determination of an individual’s residence is dependent upon an individual’s expressed intent and conduct (Matter of Palla, 31 NY2d 36, 47 [1972]).
At trial, petitioner testified that he has been the owner of 621 Brighton Beach Avenue since 1984 and that it is from that location that he has operated a meat business. He testified that the location is a two-story building containing a retail meat store on the first floor and a three bedroom apartment and office space on the second floor. He stated that this business requires him to be on the premises for many hours each day and that for approximately 10 to 12 years he slept upstairs in the apartment, sometimes as frequently as five nights per week. He went on to testify that in recent years business slowed down and that he only occasionally slept there. However, on redirect examination, petitioner testified that he had, in fact, retired in approximately June 2002 and that he, currently, only “helps out” at the business.
The testimony adduced at trial and the relevant subpoenaed documents produced —including petitioner’s driver’s license, car leases, federal tax returns, property deeds, a utility bill for the period of July 11 through August 12, 2003, an application for the New York State property tax relief program known as the “STAR” program — demonstrate that 3821 Avenue S is petitioner’s permanent and principal residence in Kings County. Notably, petitioner has failed to produce a number of subpoenaed documents, including New York State income tax returns, property leases, and phone, gas, electricity and cable bills for both premises. To the extent that petitioner has failed to produce these documents, and offers no plausible excuse for the failure to do so, an adverse inference is taken that had such documents been produced they would have supported respondents’ position that Mr. Eyzenberg did not reside at 621 Brighton Beach Avenue for Election Law purposes (see Mylonas v Town of Brookhaven, 305 AD2d 561 [2003]; Wilkie v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 274 AD2d 474 [2000]; Love v New York City Hous. Auth., 251 AD2d 553, 554 [1998]).
It is undisputed that 621 Brighton Beach Avenue has a commercial certificate of occupancy, and that plans were filed with the Buildings Department to renovate the second floor space for commercial use only. Moreover, petitioner never testified that he regards the house at 621 Brighton Beach Avenue as his permanent home to which it is his intention to return. Nor has petitioner presented any evidence from which one can reasonably infer any such intention on his part (see People v O’Hara, 96 NY2d 378, 384 [2001]; Matter of Palla v Suffolk County Bd. of Elections, 31 NY2d 36, 47 [1972]; see also Williams, 792 F2d at 327).
Based upon the foregoing, the court concludes that 621 Brighton Beach Avenue is not petitioner’s residence for purposes of the Election Law (see Thompson v Karben, 295 AD2d 438, 439 [2002] [in which the Court determined that respondent had established residence at a particular address through the submission of copies of his vehicle registration, federal income tax returns, property tax bill, a paycheck stub, and retirement account statements all bearing the address in question]; Camardi v Sinawski, 297 AD2d 357 [2002] [in which the Court determined that although testimony indicated that he had moved to Nassau County residence on October 31, 2000, he had not established residence at that particular address in light of the fact that his tax returns, driver’s license and attorney registration still listed a New York City address]; Geller v Lasher, 196 AD2d 613 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 654 [1993] [in which the Court found that respondent had sufficiently demonstrated that he maintained a residence within the meaning of the Election Law as a result of intermittently living at the address since 1981, having that address listed on his tax returns, pension documents, driver’s licenses, and insurance policies, and being listed under that address in the telephone directory]). Accordingly, the petition to validate is denied, and the petition to invalidate is granted.
. By decision and order, dated August 13, 2003, the court determined that this issue was sufficiently pleaded and could be addressed by the court.
. When petitioner became a naturalized citizen he acquired all the civil rights and privileges of a native born citizen (Baumgartner v United States, 322 US 665, 673 [1944]). Included in these rights was his common-law prerogative of changing his name without resorting to a judicial proceeding (Smith v United States Cas. Co., 197 NY 420, 428 [1910]; Matter of Burstein, 69 Misc 41 [1910]).
. Civil Rights Law § 63 states in relevant part that “[i]f the court ... is satisfied . . . that the petition is true, and that there is no reasonable objection to the change of name proposed . . . the court shall make an order authorizing the petitioner to assume the name proposed.”
. Although there was some testimony by petitioner and his wife that he was known by many as “Tony,” petitioner failed to establish that his surname was commonly known to be “Eisenberg” rather than “Eyzenberg.”
. Significantly, when petitioner’s wife testified on August 18, 2003, she identified her surname as “Eyzenberg.”
. In view of this determination, the court need not address the Board’s policy changes as they impacted upon the processing of petitioner’s voter registration. It is noted, however, that even if the July 21, 2003 data entry is deemed retroactive to the July 1, 2003 policy change (and petitioner is deemed enrolled on July 10, 2003), petitioner was given adequate notice (see, Election Law § 5-402 [2]) and an opportunity to be heard at the July 31, 2003 hearing at which that policy was reversed and petitioner’s registration cancelled.
. The court notes that some of the documents produced do in fact contain the 621 Brighton Beach Avenue address; however, these documents relate to petitioner’s business dealings.
. Even if, as petitioner contends, he spent up to 18 hours per day working at his meat business and thus “resided” at 621 Brighton Beach Avenue, petitioner acknowledges that he has been retired from the business since in or about June 2002.",0
0713-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Shirley Werner Kornreich, J.
Before the court are two applications by Randy Schindler, the first for injunctive relief and the second for, inter alia, consolidation of the instant action with Schindler v Sokol & Sokol, which is also pending in the Supreme Court, New York County, under Index No. 115087/03. The two motions are consolidated herein for unitary disposition.
Defendant Niche Media Holdings, LLC was formed in or around 1999 to manage the affairs of Hamptons Media, LLC and other magazine publishing enterprises. According to its Operating Agreement, Niche was formed for the general purpose of conducting “any and all lawful activities.” (Operating Agreement 1i 2.4, annexed to plaintiffs motion as exhibit B.) Specifically, however, it was formed to own and publish, through subsidiaries, the magazines Hamptons, Gotham and LA Confidential. Niche is the exclusive member of Hamptons, which publishes Hamptons Magazine. Niche has several members, including Schindler (a 33.3% owner) and Binn (a 35.7% owner). Schindler is chairman of the board of Niche, while Binn is Niche’s chief executive officer.
According to the complaint, the current dispute between Schindler and Binn originated in early 2003, when, through his ally, Niche attorney Golieb, Binn allegedly increased his own commissions without increasing Binn’s commensurately, withheld commissions from Schindler and canceled Schindler’s corporate credit card because he was overdrawn against his commissions, and withheld Schindler’s promised $300 weekly advance to offset the “personal” expenses that Schindler had charged to his corporate credit card. Schindler was also accused of rarely showing up for work. In response, Schindler accused Binn of, inter alia, misappropriating company assets to pay for personal furnishings and expenses. Schindler demanded, inter alia, an “accounting” of all company monies paid to Binn, as well as of the various sums that had been (wrongfully, he insisted) withheld from himself. Other quarrels also arose, in which Schindler once again accused Binn of appropriating more than his fair share of money, services and perks from Niche. Schindler began demanding copies of all communications between Binn and Golieb, as well as documentation regarding Binn’s commissions, Binn’s compliance with company obligations, and Binn’s “apparent misuse of company funds.” Schindler has formally demanded that Niche’s Board of Managers bring suit against Binn for misappropriation of company assets. Neither Binn, Niche nor Hamptons has supplied an accounting, nor have the companies commenced suit against Binn. Schindler was apparently terminated for cause on June 5, 2003.
Schindler’s seven causes of action are as follows: (1) a “derivative” claim against Binn for breach of fiduciary duty ($15 million in compensatory and punitive damages are sought); (2) a “personal” claim against Binn for $15 million for fraud perpetrated against Schindler; (3) a “derivative” claim against Binn for $15 million in compensatory and punitive damages for Binn’s alleged waste, misconduct and theft of company assets; (4) a “personal” and “derivative” demand for “an accounting of Binn’s use of any and all company funds”; (5) a “personal” and “derivative” demand, said to be against Binn, for dissolution of the company defendants, since “[liquidation of the Company Defendants is the only feasible means whereby the Companies’ members other than Binn may reasonably expect to obtain a fair return on their investment”; (6) an individual and derivative claim for $3 million for Binn’s breach of his employment contract; and (7) a permanent injunction barring Binn from serving as Niche’s CEO.
A. Schindler’s application to enjoin Binn from using company funds for his personal defense in this action:
In his first motion, plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction barring Binn “from using company funds for his personal defense” in this action. Firstly, Schindler insists that he has an “overwhelming likelihood of success on the merits,” since it is well settled that a corporation owner cannot pay his counsel fees out of corporate funds “in the context of a dissolution proceeding.” Secondly, Schindler claims that without the injunction he will suffer irreparable injury, in that Binn will have an unfair advantage over Schindler if his legal fees are paid out of company funds. Thirdly, according to Schindler, the equities favor him because he “has suffered severe financial hardship as a result of Binn’s improper efforts to oust Schindler from Niche.”
Under CPLR 6301, a plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction if he can demonstrate (1) the likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying cause of action; (2) irreparable injury in the absence of the preliminary injunction; and (3) a balancing of the equities in plaintiffs favor.
1. Likelihood of success on the merits:
Schindler has essentially no likelihood of success on the merits of either his underlying cause of action for dissolution or his application to enjoin the companies from paying Binn’s legal fees in his defense against the dissolution cause of action. Schindler relies upon rules governing derivative actions seeking corporate dissolution where, inter alia, the corporation’s shareholders are deadlocked, or the minority shareholders are pitted against the majority. (See Business Corporation Law §§ 1104, 1104-a.) However, both Niche and Hamptons are organized under New York’s Limited Liability Company Law. That legislation provides no right to bring a derivative action. The Limited Liability Company Law as originally drafted contained a provision (art IX) allowing derivative lawsuits, but “[bjecause some legislators raised questions as to the derivative rights provisions, to avoid jeopardizing passage of the Law, Article IX was excised . . . The battle to include derivative rights in the LLCL may be fought at some future date.” (Rich, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 32A, Limited Liability Company Law, 2003 Pamph, 1 [F], at 6.) Thus, Schindler’s fifth cause of action — the only one seeking dissolution of the company defendants — is subject to dismissal as unauthorized by statute — as are the other causes of action insofar as they are asserted as “derivative.”
According to section 702 of the Limited Liability Company Law, judicial dissolution of a limited liability company is only warranted when “it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity with the articles of organization or operating agreement.” While this standard has never been construed in the case law, the court interprets it to mean that judicial dissolution will be ordered only where the complaining member can show that the business sought to be dissolved is unable to function as intended, or else that it is failing financially. Schindler has nowhere so much as alleged that Niche is unable to carry on its business in accordance with its articles of organization or operating agreement, or that there is any internal “deadlock” impeding its smooth operation. In addition, the court has examined Niche’s financial statement in camera, and it shows — as even Schindler admits — that Niche publishes three very successful magazines and is quite profitable. Niche and Hamptons, which Niche owns, are therefore flourishing, and both are being conducted in conformity with their articles of organization.
Finally, the Niche Operating Agreement states that it “will indemnify and hold harmless each manager from and against all losses, liabilities, claims, demands and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses to the maximum extent permitted under the New York [Limited Liability Company] Act.” (Plaintiffs exhibit B, 1Í1Í 4.7, 1.1 [r].) According to section 420 of the Limited Liability Company Law:
“Subject to the standards and restrictions, if any, set forth in the operating agreement, a limited liability company may, and shall have the power to, indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, any member, manager or other person . . . from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever; provided, however, that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of any member, manager or other person if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such member, manager or other person establishes (a) that his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated or (b) that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled.”
There has been no judgment or other “final adjudication” establishing that Binn acted in bad faith, was dishonest, or personally gained a financial profit to which he was not entitled in his capacity as Niche’s CEO.
In short, the law and Niche’s Operating Agreement provide that Binn’s legal expenses may be paid by the company. Schindler’s argument that none of Binn’s expenses may be paid by Niche because one of his seven causes of action seeks dissolution of Niche and Hamptons would, if accepted, create the unworkable dilemma that Binn could have his defense paid for by Niche as to six causes of action, but not as to the seventh. However, the dilemma is not presented, since Schindler may not under the Limited Liability Company Law sue derivatively for the defendant companies’ dissolution, and the defendants are accordingly not bound by the rules governing derivative lawsuits for judicial dissolution of corporations.
2. Irreparable injury:
The court is not persuaded that Schindler will suffer irreparable injury if Niche pays for Binn’s defense. By Schindler’s reasoning, the court would have to make certain that in every case before it the litigants have equal financial resources, or else somehow divest the richer party of assets to diminish his “unfair advantage.” Clearly, counsel’s competence is not dependent upon who pays him/her.
3. Balancing of the equities:
There are no equities that favor the plaintiff. Both Niche’s Operating Agreement and the Limited Liability Company Law permit the payment of Binn’s attorney’s fees. In contrast, there is no law or contract provision that favors barring company aid to Binn in his legal defense. Moreover, it would be wasteful to require Binn and the company defendants to duplicate each other’s defenses against a complaint whose allegations respecting the various defendants are jumbled together, with the result that it is not always clear which defendant is being targeted. Finally, although Schindler complains that he has been impoverished by Binn’s, inter alia, taking more than his fair share of company monies, it appears from Schindler’s own pleading that Binn et al. have registered similar complaints against Schindler. Accordingly, as between plunderer and plundered, it cannot be said at this stage of the proceedings where the equities lie.
Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore denied, and the existing TRO (temporary restraining order) is vacated. The court declines to address plaintiffs accusation that defendants violated the TRO while it was in existence.
B. Schindler’s application to, inter alia, consolidate the instant case with Schindler v Sokol & Sokol (Index No. 115087/03), pending in Supreme Court, New York County:
On August 22, 2003, Schindler served a first amended verified complaint on the defendants herein, in which he elaborated on a plot allegedly contrived by Binn — with the help of Niche attorney Golieb, accountant Brad Sokol, Niche chief operating officer Caryn Whitman, and Modern Luxury magazine’s principal Michael Kong — in which Niche’s true financial condition was concealed from Schindler preparatory to a lucrative (for Binn) merger of Niche with Modern Luxury magazine.
Shortly after amending his complaint in the instant action, Schindler served a first amended complaint in a second lawsuit that he had also commenced in Supreme Court, New York County, against Niche’s accounting firm Sokol & Sokol, its accountant Brad Sokol, and its chief operating officer Caryn Whitman (Schindler v Sokol & Sokol, Sup Ct, NY County, Index No. 115087/03). The “plot” surrounding the planned merger of Niche with Modern Luxury magazine is again outlined, and the defendants are charged with aiding and abetting Binn in his effort to defraud Schindler. The list of “parties” in the complaint in Schindler v Sokol & Sokol includes John D. Howard, Charles Layton and Moretón Binn (collectively, the nonparty Niche managers), and in causes of actions No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 Schindler, “derivatively,” accuses these three individuals of breaching their fiduciary duties to the “Company Plaintiffs” in that they had allegedly aided Binn and his other accomplices in their breaches of their fiduciary duties to the “Company Plaintiffs.” On behalf of the “Company Plaintiffs,” Schindler demands $15 million from each of these gentlemen. The court notes that the caption in the second lawsuit reads: “randy schindler, individually, and in his capacity as a member of Niche Media Holdings, LLC, and through Niche Media Holdings, LLC, in his capacity as a member of Hamptons Media, LLC, Plaintiffs, against sokol & sokol, cpa, brad sokol, and caryn whitman, Defendants.” There are no “Company Plaintiffs,” and Howard, Layton and Moretón Binn are not named as defendants. It further does not appear that Howard, Layton and Moretón Binn have ever been served.
1. Motion to consolidate:
Defendants in the instant action do not object to that branch of Schindler’s application which seeks to consolidate the instant lawsuit with Schindler v Sokol & Sokol. However, the court is loath to consolidate with the instant action another lawsuit where it is not clear who the plaintiffs and who the defendants are. In addition, as plaintiffs counsel admits in paragraph 10 of his affirmation in support of the instant order to show cause, “the liability of defendants in the Sokol Action is predicated upon plaintiff proving his case in the Binn Action.” Where, as here, resolution of the underlying dispute will most likely be dispositive of the related case, a motion for consolidation should be denied. (See Sokolow, Dunaud, Mercadier & Carreras v Lacher, 299 AD2d 64 [1st Dept 2002] [order directing consolidation reversed and related action stayed pending resolution of underlying conflict].)
2. Expedited discovery and priority of discovery:
Schindler seeks “expedited discovery,” suggesting that he just learned about Binn’s “looting” of the defendant companies’ assets and that the companies’ financial health will be damaged if Schindler does not intervene quickly. However, as noted above, Schindler has been making essentially the same accusations against Binn since at least 2000, and the instant action was more than four months old when Schindler made his motion for expedited discovery. In addition, according to Niche chief operating officer Caryn Whitman, Niche is financially healthy, with four times the cash on hand than is required by current liabilities and a projected year-end profit of more than $2 million.
Schindler additionally seeks priority of discovery on the ground that he will soon move to have a temporary receiver appointed for Niche. However, Schindler has no grounds for seeking a temporary receiver. In the case that he relies upon, Rosan v Vassell (257 AD2d 436, 437 [1st Dept 1999]), the Court noted that it was appointing a temporary receiver because there was “compelling evidence of a struggle within the subject corporation threatening its continued viability.” As noted above, the company defendants at bar are not corporations, and there is no “struggle” within either Niche or Hamptons threatening the continued viability of either. Indeed, the only Niche manager who appears to be unhappy is Schindler.
Schindler also claims entitlement to priority of discovery on the ground that such relief is traditionally granted in actions alleging a breach of a fiduciary relationship between the parties— usually arising from a business enterprise involving the parties — in which the pertinent facts are solely within the knowledge of the defendant. (See Bel Geddes v Zeiderman, 228 AD2d 393 [1st Dept 1996]; NOPA Realty Corp. v Central Caterers, 91 AD2d 991 [2d Dept 1983].) However, it is equally well established that the mere allegation of a breach of fiduciary duty is not sufficient to upset a defendant’s right to priority. (See Hakim Consultants v Formosa Ltd., 175 AD2d 759 [1st Dept 1991].) Here it is clear that the facts relating to Binn’s alleged breach of his fiduciary duty are not in Binn’s exclusive possession. For example, Schindler has already acquired “critical” documents from nonparty Michael Kong, and he is seeking further discovery from nonparty John Golieb. Defendants also insist that all of the details of Binn’s negotiations with Kong and Modern Luxury were known to all members of Niche’s board, including plaintiff, so that plaintiff himself is in full possession of the facts underlying his claim.
3. Open Commission:
Schindler seeks, pursuant to CPLR 3108 and 3111, an open commission to obtain document and deposition discovery from Michael Kong in Chicago, Illinois. Defendants oppose the application, as a sanction for plaintiffs prior discovery abuses, which they describe as follows:
On June 12, 2003, defendants were served with a notice of subpoena to Michael Kong in Chicago, requiring him to produce certain documents at the New York office of plaintiffs counsel on June 10, 2003 — two days earlier. Defendants’ attorney wrote to plaintiffs counsel that the subpoena was invalid, inter alia, because defendants had not received timely notice of it, because Kong had been given less than the 20 days’ notice required by CPLR 3106 (b), and because a New York attorney had no authority to subpoena discovery from a nonparty in Chicago in that fashion. Defendants’ attorney requested that the notice be withdrawn. Plaintiffs counsel ignored the request, apparently obtained the documents, and has not supplied defendants with copies, even though Niche has offered to pay for photocopying. Schindler has not submitted a reply affidavit contradicting defendants’ account of these transactions. The court therefore denies Schindler’s application for an open commission, for an order compelling Kong to turn over certain documents, and for an order compelling Kong to return an unidentified “transcript of the testimony subscribed by the witnesses.”
Accordingly, it is ordered that plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction restraining defendant Jason Binn from using the funds of Niche and/or Hamptons for his defense in this action is denied; and it is further ordered that the existing temporary restraining order is vacated and dissolved; and it is further ordered that plaintiffs application to consolidate the instant action with Schindler v Sokol & Sokol (Sup Ct, NY County, Index No. 115087/03) is denied; and it is further ordered that plaintiffs application for priority of disclosure on an expedited basis is denied; and it is further ordered that plaintiffs application for an open commission to obtain documents and to take a deposition of nonparty Michael Kong, residing in Chicago, Illinois, is denied; and it is further ordered that plaintiffs application to compel Michael Kong to produce documents and a transcript of unidentified testimony is denied.
. In 2000, Schindler brought a suit against Binn in Suffolk County, seeking, inter alia, dissolution of Hamptons, an accounting, and damages because of an alleged breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Binn and other members of the board of Hamptons Magazine. (Schindler v Hamptons Mag., LLC, Sup Ct, Suffolk County, Index No. 00-17882.) That action was ultimately withdrawn on stipulation of the parties, with Schindler retracting as without factual basis certain defamatory allegations against Binn which have reappeared in the instant lawsuit.
. The court rejects as unsubstantiated Schindler’s suggestion that the companies’ financiad reports were drafted based upon false information given by Binn.
. Even using the standards for judicial dissolution set out in the Business Corporation Law, Schindler’s complaint falls short. No “deadlock” among shareholders is alleged (Business Corporation Law § 1104), and this seems less a case of “looting” by Binn than one of personal animosity between Binn and Schindler in which intemperate accusations have been exchanged (Business Corporation Law § 1104-a). In any event, even assuming that Binn is improperly withholding from Schindler sums due to Schindler, it is by no means clear on this record that liquidation of the businesses “is the only feasible means whereby the petitioners may reasonably expect to obtain a fair return on their investment” and that liquidation “is reasonably necessary for the protection of the rights and interests of any substantial number of shareholders or of the petitioners” (Business Corporation Law § 1104-a [b] [1], [2]).
. This planned merger ultimately fell through.",0
0703-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Daniel K. Lalor, J.
Defendant is charged with two counts of vehicular assault in the second degree as a class E felony in violation of Penal Law § 120.03, and two counts of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol as a misdemeanor in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1192, one count in each case being based upon blood alcohol content allegedly in excess of 0.10% (0.14%) and one count upon common-law intoxication, for having in such condition with criminal negligence allegedly operated a 2002 Honda motor vehicle on State Route 23A in the Town of Hunter on March 24, 2002 at 5:10 a.m. at a speed not reasonable and prudent for the road conditions, causing said vehicle to travel off the shoulder of the road and strike a retaining wall, and thereby causing serious physical injury to Rebecca Dragosits, a passenger in the vehicle, including a lacerated spleen and fractured vertebra. Defendant moved to dismiss for denial of his statutory speedy trial rights pursuant to CPL 30.30, and the court denied the motion without a hearing on September 2, 2003. Defendant moved to reargue, and the court granted defendant’s application.
Having heard the parties in reargument, the court hereby withdraws its original decision dated September 2, 2003 and issues the following decision in its stead.
Speedy Trial
Defendant argues that the People were obliged to produce the grand jury minutes to the court within a reasonable time after service of its omnibus motion, that they unreasonably delayed production, and that the period of unreasonable delay added to the chargeable prereadiness delay exceeds the statutory readiness period, requiring dismissal of the indictment.
In defendant’s analysis, there is a speedy trial “clock” that accrues days chargeable to the People, which starts upon commencement of the action, stops during any “excludable” period, restarts at the end of the “excludable” period, stops upon the People’s announcement of readiness, and thereafter restarts whenever there is unreasonable delay on the part of the People in performing an act that is necessary to their continued readiness for trial. Defendant argues furthermore that only during the “pre-readiness” period do the. exclusions provided by CPL 30.30 (4) come into play.
The Court of Appeals’ methodology for prereadiness calculations under CPL 30.30 is to (1) determine the commencement of the action, (2) measure six months from commencement, (3) determine the number of days in this period, (4) determine the date of effective readiness communication, (5) calculate the number of days from commencement to communication of readiness, and (6) compare to the readiness period. If the number of days until readiness exceeds the number of days in the six-month speedy trial period, then the court must determine the existence and length of any excludable periods, for the action must be dismissed “unless sufficient time is excludable to shorten the period of delay chargeable to the People to six months or less” (People v Hamilton, 46 NY2d 932, 933 [1979]). If the People announce readiness within the statutory period, the existence and length of any excludable periods must still be determined, for the People “are entitled to the full period allowed, either before or after answering ready,” and are therefore entitled to “tack” all “unused” readiness time, including time resulting from an exclusion, onto their postreadiness time (see, People v Anderson, 66 NY2d 529, 537 [1985]). This is the methodology followed by the court in analyzing the prereadiness period.
In felony cases such as this one, CPL 30.30 requires the People to be ready for trial within six months of the commencement of the criminal action (CPL 30.30 [1] [a]). The felony charges against defendant were lodged April 17, 2002. The statutory six-month readiness period extended to October 17, 2002, a period of 183 days. The People effectively communicated readiness for trial 168 days after commencement by written notice filed upon return of the indictment and hand delivered to defense counsel on October 2, 2002 (see People v Carter, 91 NY2d 795 [1998]; People v Goss, 87 NY2d 792, 794 [1996]). A pertinent preindictment time period is the 22-day interval between September 10, 2002 (the date of defense counsel’s letter confirming defendant’s request for a postponement of the first scheduled grand jury presentment, and the date said letter was stamped “Received” by the District Attorney’s office) and October 2, 2002 (the actual date of grand jury presentment). On November 22, 2002 defendant served an omnibus motion including a motion to inspect the grand jury minutes and to dismiss, and a motion to suppress, made returnable by defendant 53 days later on January 14, 2003. One day after the return date, on January 15, 2003, the court issued its decision on the omnibus motion, ordering in camera production of the grand jury minutes and a suppression hearing with respect to defendant’s statements. Grand jury minutes were received by the court on February 13, 2003, 30 days after the court’s order, 83 days after service of defendant’s motion, and 1 day prior to the suppression hearing on February 14, 2003.
Applying the method outlined above, the People communicated readiness with 15 days left to run in the 183-day readiness period that commenced on April 17, 2002. To this must be added 22 excludable days attributable to defendant’s request to adjourn the grand jury proceeding. Accordingly, entering the postreadiness period the People are credited with 37 days of unexpired readiness time.
Service on November 22, 2002 of defendant’s omnibus motion containing a motion to inspect the grand jury minutes and to dismiss triggered an obligation on the part of the People to produce minutes to the court within a “reasonable time” thereafter (People v Harris, 82 NY2d 409 [1993]). In fact, minutes were produced 83 days after service of the motion. A “reasonable time” is to be excluded from this 83-day period in determining how many days should be “charged” to the People as “unreasonable delay” (People v Dearstyne, 215 AD2d 864, 866 [3d Dept 1995]). What time is a “reasonable time” within which to produce minutes is subject to a case-by-case inquiry; however if, for purposes of argument, it were assumed to be 36 days (see, People v Harris, supra at 414), then 47 of the 83 days represent unreasonable delay “chargeable” to the People’s speedy trial time. Since 47 exceeds by 10 the People’s “tachable” reserve of 37 days, defendant argues the indictment must be dismissed.
The court rejects this conclusion, on several bases.
First, the situation here differs markedly from that in People v Harris, in that it is the routine practice of this court for it to issue, as part of its omnibus decision, a separate ruling granting the motion to inspect the grand jury minutes, and then, at a later time, to rule on the motion to dismiss, after the minutes have been inspected. That inspection, moreover, is most commonly performed only after the omnibus motion, containing the motion to inspect and to dismiss, has been fully submitted or argued. Orderly procedure in this county has not been affected by the People providing minutes only after issuance of the court’s decision on the omnibus motion decision, in accordance with the court’s order (see, People v Endres, 178 Misc 2d 305 [1998]). Nor, generally, has there been a need for the court to review the minutes prior to argument of the omnibus motion.
To the contrary, there are sound reasons for delaying review of the minutes until after the omnibus motion has been fully submitted or argued. Frequently, the omnibus motion brings forth specific issues upon which the defendant requests the court to focus in its review beyond simple legal sufficiency of the evidence, issues such as the quality of instructions given by the prosecutor, the alleged failure to charge required affirmative defenses, the alleged absence of required corroboration, alleged prosecutorial interference with the defendant’s right to testify before the grand jury, or impairment of the integrity of the grand jury proceeding itself allegedly caused by unauthorized persons present, the lack of a quorum or the People’s failure to recuse grand jurors who have indicated possible bias or knowledge of the case. The People’s response and oral argument serve to further sharpen these issues. Where such contentions have been raised in a defendant’s omnibus motion, the court typically reserves decision pending review of the minutes, noting the need to give specific attention to the issues raised. Review of the minutes in such cases prior to argument would predictably lead only to well-founded motions to reargue, and the need for the court to review the minutes a second time. Where minutes are being produced for the court’s in camera review, moreover, reasonableness is determined in the first instance by the court’s expectations, not by the defendant’s. Thus, it was reasonable in this case for the People to expect that the court would require the minutes no earlier than its consideration of the omnibus motion. In fact, the People here furnished minutes to the court 30 days after production was ordered.
The determination of what constitutes a “reasonable” time to produce minutes is a case-by-case determination, with 36 days being only the period that was found reasonable in Harris. While it has been common practice for the minutes to be reviewed after issuance of the omnibus decision, it is true that in cases where the People have of their own accord furnished minutes earlier, the court has on occasion incorporated its decision on grand jury review into its omnibus decision. In this case, had the minutes been available on January 14, it is conceivable the court would have issued such a combined decision, although in all likelihood it would have taken more than one day to do so.
The court here determines that, in view of its practice of reviewing minutes only after the omnibus motion has been decided, in view of its practice of deciding omnibus motions promptly after their submission, and in view of the lengthy 53-day delay between service of the defendant’s omnibus motion and its return date (which date was selected by defense counsel), a “reasonable” time for the People to have produced the grand jury minutes to the court would have been upon argument of the omnibus motion. In other words, of the 83 days between omnibus motion and production of the minutes that, under Harris, the “speedy trial clock” was potentially “running,” the People should be presumptively “charged” with only the last 31 days, the time between argument of the motion and the date the minutes were produced. Only during this period did the People’s delay in producing minutes have arguable potential to actually delay the trial, the sole predicate for holding such delay to be a “chargeable” speedy trial delay (see People v McKenna, 76 NY2d 59, 64 [1990]). Since, when this time is deducted from the People’s 37-day “tachable reserve,” the People are 6 days within the statutory period, it is unnecessary to hold a hearing to determine the reason for the delay, or whether any part of this postreadiness delay should be excluded as due to “exceptional circumstances” outside the People’s control (see CPL 30.30 [4] [gl).
Second, not discussed in Harris is the effect of other statutory exclusions contained within CPL 30.30 (4) (a). Contrary to defendant’s argument, statutory exclusions do indeed apply to the postreadiness period (see, People v Batts, 227 AD2d 224 [1996]). In discussing the rule for readiness computations, the Court of Appeals has stated,
“Whether the People have satisfied this obligation is generally determined by computing the time elapsed between the filing of the first accusatory instrument and the People’s declaration of readiness, subtracting any periods of delay that are excludable under the terms of the statute and then adding to the result any postreadiness periods of delay that are actually attributable to the People and are ineligible for an exclusion.” (People v Cortes, 80 NY2d 201, 208 [1992] [emphasis added]; see People v Frazier, 175 AD2d 257, 258 [1991].)
Furthermore, the language of CPL 30.30 (4) is mandatory: “In computing the time within which the people must be ready for trial pursuant to subdivisions one and two, the following periods must be excluded ...” (emphasis added). In construing the exclusions of CPL 30.30 (4), the Court of Appeals has also stated that
“Inasmuch as the Legislature intended CPL 30.30 to address delays caused by the People, the time required for defendant’s pretrial motions and his requested adjournments should be excluded. Those delays have been caused by the defendant for his own benefit, and with the court’s permission, under circumstances in which both the defendant and the court have determined that the adjournment is desirable. In view of the defendant’s express waiver of the delay, the People are not required to causally trace their lack of readiness to defendant’s actions before the court is warranted in excluding the periods resulting from adjournments authorized by subdivision 4 (a) and (b).” (People v Worley, 66 NY2d 523, 527 [1985] [emphasis added].)
Similarly, the Court of Appeals’ constructions of CPL 30.30 demand that “all excludable periods must be deducted from the ‘total time’ . . . starting with the filing of the accusatory instrument” (People v Sinistaj, 67 NY2d 236, 240 [1986] [emphasis added]), because, “[u]nder the clear language of CPL 30.30 (subd 4, par [a]), such periods would generally be excluded from the total time within which the People are required by statute to become ready to proceed to trial” (People v Lomax, 50 NY2d 351, 357 [1980] [emphasis added]).
Thus, when an event described in CPL 30.30 (4) (a) occurs during an otherwise “dockable” period of postreadiness delay, a corresponding exclusion must and should be granted to the People, whether or not the event has directly to do with the reason that the speedy trial “clock” was restarted.
It is well settled that “when an omnibus motion is made a reasonable time for response by the prosecution may be excluded in the computation of the period of delay chargeable to the People following a request for disposition of outstanding charges (People v Chiofalo, 73 AD2d 673 [1979]). Excludable, too, may be the period for decision of the motion by the Judge by whom it was heard” (People v Torres, 60 NY2d 119, 127 [1983]). The length of the allowable excludable period is “the period of delay, if any, which in the individual case may be actually ascribed to consideration and determination of the particular motion” (People v Torres, supra at 128; see, People v Gonzalez, 266 AD2d 562, 563 [2d Dept 1999]).
Defendant’s omnibus motion here included not only a motion to inspect and dismiss, but a motion to suppress. The suppression motion, under CPL 30.30 (4) (a), was a parallel reason to immediately “stop the clock” that was started by the inspection motion, and one measure of the resulting exclusion is that the entire “postreadiness time from defendant’s motion to dismiss to [the trial court’s decision] is not chargeable to the People (CPL 30.30 [4] [a])” (People v Hughes, 180 AD2d 908, 909 [3d Dept 1992]).
“When, as here, a court orders that a suppression hearing must be conducted, it necessarily defers a final decision on the defendant’s pretrial motion to suppress. Indeed, by ordering the hearing in the first place, the court implicitly concludes that suppression cannot be granted or denied summarily {see CPL 710.60 [2], [3]), and that the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law can be rendered only after the reception of evidence. (See CPL 710.60 [4].) As a consequence, both sides are entitled to a reasonable period of time to prepare for the suppression hearing, and the delay that results from such an adjournment must be excluded as a necessary incident to the pretrial motions made by the defendant. (See People v Green, 90 AD2d 705 [1st Dept 1982], lv denied 58 NY2d 784 [1982]; cf. People v Santiago, 147 Misc 2d 143, 145 [Crim Ct, NY County 1990] [‘the granting of a hearing may be properly considered a part of motion practice and thus excludable pursuant to CPL 30.30 (4) (a)’].) Thus . . . the People were entitled to a reasonable adjournment to prepare for the hearing that had been ordered.” (People v Simpkins, 193 Misc 2d 148, 151-152 [2001], affd 193 Misc 2d 447 [2002], lv denied 99 NY2d 585 [2003].)
Under this reasoning, the entire period from service of defendant’s omnibus motion through the court’s decision in March 2003 following the hearing held February 14, 2003 falls within an excludable period that arises due to defendant’s motion to suppress. The court fails to see how the speedy trial “clock” could “tick” during such a period, especially since a suppression issue is of the same character as a motion to inspect and dismiss, i.e., pendency of either motion impedes commencement of the trial (People v Simpkins, supra at 153; CPL 710.40 [3]; see, e.g., People v Lloyd, 141 AD2d 669 [2d Dept 1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 787 [1988]; compare, People v McKenna, supra at 64).
A more defense-oriented view is that there should be excluded only a “reasonable period” of time necessary to respond to the omnibus motion. The People filed their responding papers on December 13, 2002, corresponding to an excludable period of 21 days. To this must be added the one day during which the fully submitted motion was “under consideration by the court” (CPL 30.30 [4] [a]; People v Batts, supra; People v Gonzalez, supra at 563). These 22 days, when added to the 37 days “unused” readiness time, total 59 days to be excluded from the 83 days it took the People to produce minutes, thus shortening that potentially “chargeable” time to 24 days, 12 days less than the 36-day period found “reasonable” in Harris.
One could reasonably argue, however, that a “reasonable period” to respond to the omnibus motion should be measured not by the People’s actual response, but by their obligation to respond, and that time was considerably expanded here by the defendant’s own choice of a return day 53 days in the future. In contrast to practice elsewhere (see, e.g., People v Gonzalez, 266 AD2d 562 [1999]), criminal motion practice in this county has traditionally followed timetables drawn from civil motion practice, governed by the CPLR. The public defender routinely demands answering papers to his omnibus motions at least seven days prior to the return date pursuant to CPLR 2214 (b); it appears, however, that he did not do so here. Thus, under prevailing local practice the People’s responding omnibus papers were not due until two days prior to the return date (CPLR 2214 [b]). By this reasoning, all but 2 days of the 53-day period between service of the omnibus motion and its return date should be excludable, as must the 1 day during which the fully submitted motion was “under consideration by the court.” These 52 days, when added to the 37 days “unused” readiness time, total 89 excludable days, 6 days more than the 83 days it took the People to produce grand jury minutes.
Third, and not necessary to the result reached, the precise holding of Harris (82 NY2d at 413) is that “where the People make no objection to the branch of the CPL 210.30 motion seeking inspection of the Grand Jury minutes, the People’s obligation to produce the Grand Jury minutes within a reasonable time begins to run from the date the defendant’s CPL 210.30 motion (to inspect the Grand Jury minutes and to dismiss the indictment) is made.” But, the People are not required to make the decision (whether to oppose the motion to inspect) until the day that their response to the motion is required. In addition to the “reasonable time” within which to produce the minutes, in accordance with CPL 30.30 (4) (a) there ought to be excluded from the Harris formula as determined above, a further “reasonable period” of delay for the People to determine their course in responding to the motion, including an assessment of whether there may be “good cause” to oppose the motion to inspect (see People v Van Deusen, 228 AD2d 987, 989 [3d Dept 1996]). Without determining what that length of time ought to have been in this case, the court may observe that it seems unfair to the People to penalize them retroactively for making full use of time given them by statute.
Under any of the above lines of reasoning, the People are within their speedy trial time.
Defendant’s alternative argument is that the “speedy trial clock” restarted on November 11, 2002 upon defendant’s discovery demand for his own grand jury testimony. The court rejects this argument because there are lesser sanctions available in the postreadiness context for delays in furnishing discovery material (People v Anderson, 66 NY2d 529 [1985]). To adopt this theory, moreover, would require an analysis of how to appropriately combine postreadiness delay of two different types: delay that ultimately may warrant dismissal, and delay that does not. It should be evident that speedy trial analysis under CPL 30.30 is complicated enough without introduction of such imponderables.
Based on the foregoing analysis, the motion is denied without necessity of a factual hearing to determine the cause for the People’s delay.
The parties have referred to September 11, 2002 as the start of the excludable period, probably because that is the date for which the grand jury presentment was originally scheduled. The exclusion arises, however, not from the fact that the presentment was adjourned, but from the fact that the defendant requested the adjournment (see, People v Meierdiercks, 68 NY2d 613 [1986]; People v Hudson, 264 AD2d 598 [1999]; People v Greene, 223 AD2d 474 [1996]). As reflected in the record, that request appears to have been made informally on or about September 9, and was documented by defendant’s letter to the Assistant District Attorney on September 10, 2002.",0
0156-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Daniel Turbow, J.
Respondents in these two neglect proceedings brought pursuant to article 10 of the Family Court Act are mothers who are, or recently were, in foster care under the jurisdiction of the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS). By this consolidated motion, respondents argue that ACS has a conflict of interest in prosecuting cases which seek a finding of neglect against persons for whom they serve as parens patriae. As the primary remedy for this alleged conflict, they seek an order relieving ACS “as the petitioner in the instant matters . . . and appointing a non-governmental agency as a special prosecutor.”
Respondents’ motion is predicated upon the facially appealing policy argument that ACS, in its role as guardian of a minor parent such as respondents, should be seeking to avert a finding of neglect which may have serious long-term consequences for the parent. By definition, it is abdicating that obligation when it prosecutes a neglect proceeding against that parent. Moreover, while respondents acknowledge that ACS has an obligation to safeguard the children of minor parents as well as the minor parents themselves, they challenge ACS’ assertion that the only appropriate way that obligation can be satisfied is through the successful prosecution of a neglect proceeding. As will be discussed more fully below, the concerns raised by respondents are weighty and implicate important issues such as the circumstances under which it is appropriate to saddle a minor parent with the stigma of a neglect finding and its attendant consequences. However, we conclude that there is no basis for the relief sought. To the extent ACS suffers a “conflict of interest” it is one which is inherent to its statutory obligations. The court lacks the authority to intervene in the manner ACS chooses to satisfy those obligations in the fashion respondents suggest. To accept respondents’ argument would mean that, as a matter of law, a “special prosecutor” would be required in every article 10 case filed against a minor parent in foster care. Plainly, such a dramatic overhaul of the entire foster care system should not be effected by judicial fiat.
Nonetheless, we take this opportunity to urge ACS to evaluate such cases with due regard to the age of the respondent and with recognition that the law prohibits minor parents from being held to the same standard of care as adults. In the appropriate case, such an evaluation should cause the agency to conclude that a finding of neglect is not warranted while, at the same time, permitting the agency to assure the safety of the minor parent’s offspring pursuant to its explicit authority to “assume charge” of a destitute child under Social Services Law § 398.
A. Facts
I. Matter of Alice Peters. The respondent in this proceeding is Barbara Allen, who was born April 23, 1986. She was placed in foster care in 1995 as a result of the neglect of her mother. She gave birth to the subject child Alice on June 5, 2001. Apparently the mother and child thereafter lived in the same foster home.
On or about August 6, 2002, ACS commenced the instant proceeding against the minor parent, alleging that she had neglected her child in that, among other things, she had left the child with her foster parent on July 5, 2002 without making provisions for the child’s care and had failed to return. Alice was remanded to the care of ACS, in whose custody she remains. The mother subsequently appeared in court in connection with the proceeding and was assigned counsel.
On August 13, 2002, an amended petition was filed which contained additional allegations that the mother abused marijuana.
ACS thereafter reported that the mother had left her foster home without permission and that her whereabouts were unknown. On November 20, 2002, the mother failed to appear in court as required and an inquest was conducted. The court reserved decision at the conclusion of ACS’ case. This motion followed.
II. Matter of Lawrence Children. The respondent mother of the three subject children in this proceeding is Gail Lawrence, who was born on June 1, 1983. In 1997, she was voluntarily placed with ACS by her sister, who had become Gail’s guardian upon the death of her parents.
On May 8, 2000, while in foster care, the mother gave birth to twins: Susan Lawrence and Sally Lawrence. On August 1, 2000, ACS commenced a child protective proceeding against the mother, alleging that she had failed to provide the twins adequate guardianship in a number of ways. On March 2, 2001, following inquest, Judge Susan Knipps found that the mother had neglected the children by, among other things, leaving them with her former foster parent without appropriate arrangements for their care. The twins were thereafter placed with ACS.
On August 30, 2001, the mother gave birth to a third child, Sarah Lawrence. On March 5, 2002, ACS brought the instant proceeding, naming as subject children Sarah as well as the twins, with respect to whom placement had inadvertently lapsed. The petition alleges that the respondent failed to plan for the children by, among other things, repeatedly leaving foster care without permission for lengthy periods of time, failing to maintain contact with the foster care agency, and failing to visit or follow through with her service plan. The twins continued in the care of ACS. Although Sarah was originally paroled to her mother, the child was thereafter remanded to ACS upon a showing that the mother had admitted to caseworkers that she was abusing marijuana and did not have a stable residence. On September 17, 2002, an amended petition was filed which raised those matters. Fact-finding has been adjourned in view of this motion.
It should be noted that a question exists as to whether the respondent was actually in placement with ACS at the time this proceeding was commenced on March 5, 2002. She was clearly in placement until her 18th birthday on June 1, 2001. However, at that time she did not provide the consent necessary to its continuation. (See Family Ct Act § 1055 [e].) In fact, she allegedly was “AWOL” from placement at that time. Nonetheless, the agency affirmatively asserted in its petition that she was in foster care at the time of its filing, and apparently she was formally discharged from placement as a result of a “discharge conference” held on October 18, 2002. To the extent that the issue becomes relevant at fact-finding it will have to be resolved at that time. For current purposes we assume that the respondent was indeed in foster care at the time of the petition’s filing and that the motion is thus apposite to her case.
B. Discussion
As noted at the outset, respondents’ contention that ACS has a “conflict of interest” has a surface plausibility. However, upon close examination it becomes clear that respondents’ analysis and legal arguments are faulty. Certainly, they do not support invocation of the remedy respondents advance.
Respondents contend that the issue should be viewed through the prism of those legal principles which govern attorneys’ conduct. They assert correctly that under the Code of Professional Responsibility an attorney plainly cannot represent conflicting interests. (See Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-105 [22 NYCRR 1200.24].) They then state that the conflict of interest suffered by ACS is “imputed to counsel for ACS when they are arguing [in these cases] a position that is in clear contradiction to their own client’s position” when the client is advancing, in another context, the interests of the respondent minor parents. (Feb. 19, 2003 Green affidavit in support.) Ergo, they conclude that the attorneys, who are employees of ACS, must be disqualified and replaced by a “special prosecutor.”
The fundamental flaw in this presentation is that the ACS attorneys do not, by reason of their representation, have a “conflict of interest,” within the meaning of the Code of Professional Responsibility. They are representing a client — ACS— and, in the absence of some suggestion that they are not acting with undivided loyalty to that client, the principles codified in the Code of Professional Responsibility upon which respondents rely have no applicability. And, of course, to the extent respondents seek to invoke those principles as governing the conduct of ACS itself, the short answer is that the Code of Professional Responsibility governs the conduct of attorneys— not the conduct of administrative agencies. (See Code of Professional Responsibility, Preliminary Statement [“Obviously the Canons, Ethical Considerations, and Disciplinary Rules cannot apply to non-lawyers”].)
The case law cited by respondents in this regard is thus inapplicable. It all involves circumstances where a conflict was found because the attorney at issue was being called upon to simultaneously represent separate parties who had actual or potentially adverse interests. (See, e.g., Hanna v Rewkowski, 81 Misc 2d 498 [Sup Ct, Oneida County 1975]; Matter of Randy G., 127 Misc 2d 1079 [Fam Ct, Kings County 1985].) Neither these nor any other cited cases stand for the proposition that an attorney should be disqualified because — as is arguably the case here— his or her single client is taking inconsistent positions.
That is not to say that there might not be circumstances where disqualification of ACS counsel might be appropriate. Most directly, an ACS attorney might be disqualified from representing the agency in a neglect proceeding if he or she had previously represented a respondent in another proceeding. But, again, that would be because of a conflict — or the appearance of a conflict — stemming from the representation of two separate entities with adverse interests. (See generally People v Schiraldi, 93 Misc 2d 343, 346 [Crim Ct, Queens County 1977] [discussing circumstances in which ethical conflicts might arise in office of District Attorney with respect to criminal prosecution; “The reported cases of disqualification generally involve situations in which the prosecutor has a personal interest in the outcome of the case, either by virtue of being the victim of a crime or because the prosecutor had prior professional involvement with the defendant” (citations omitted)].)
It also warrants note in this regard that while ACS has an obligation to minor parents in its care, there is no suggestion that ACS counsel has an attorney-client relationship with those parents which would somehow be compromised by that counsel’s continued participation in these proceedings. Indeed, under the Family Court Act the minor parents are entitled to totally independent counsel — in the form of a law guardian — when they are before the court as the subject children in neglect proceedings (see Family Ct Act § 1016), as well as when they are respondents in such proceedings (see Family Ct Act § 262). Moreover, it is common for the law guardian to take a position on behalf of a subject child which is adverse to that of ACS. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that ACS counsel is betraying any loyalty it has qua attorney towards a minor parent in ACS’ care when it represents ACS in a proceeding against that minor parent.
Without this proffered underpinning to their argument, respondents are essentially relegated to focusing upon the apparent inequity of having ACS pursue an article 10 proceeding against those individuals whom it was mandated to protect, and contending that policy considerations should absolutely bar ACS from bringing such proceedings under these circumstances. They suggest instead that ACS could achieve the same result it desires by bringing a case under article 7 to have a malfeasant minor parent declared a person in need of supervision (PINS), much as a parent or guardian of such a minor parent might do.
In response, ACS acknowledges that it has a parens patriae relationship to children in its care. (See, e.g., Palmer v Cuomo, 121 AD2d 194 [1st Dept 1986].) However, it emphasizes that it also has the legislative authority and responsibility to prosecute cases under article 10 when, in its discretion, it is believed necessary for the protection of a child. It cannot be foreclosed from exercising its authority simply because the parent of an allegedly neglected or abused child is in foster care. In any event, article 7 is inapposite to the ends ACS hopes to achieve.
Moreover, ACS continues, respondents overstate their case. In fact, its position vis-a-vis the respondents is not as adversarial as it might at first seem since the agency has the statutory obligation to attempt to keep a respondent parent and child together. Thus, among other things, it must make “reasonable efforts” to prevent the removal of a child (see, e.g., Family Ct Act § 1022), and if the child is put in its care, it must utilize “diligent efforts” to foster “a meaningful relationship between the parent and child.” (Social Services Law § 384-b [7] [f].) Therefore, they argue
“[i]n all child protective cases . . . ACS is obligated to those respondents who are legally adverse to them by the very nature of them being respondents. The mere fact that ACS has initiated and presented evidence against respondents in their care does not necessitate that it has abandoned its duties to these foster children by doing so.” (Mar. 3, 2003 affidavit in opposition at 12.)
They also point to the body of law that holds an article 10 proceeding is “remedial, not punitive” (see, e.g., Matter of Jessica C., 132 Misc 2d 596, 603 [Fam Ct, Queens County 1986]), and. suggest that respondents are exaggerating the consequences of a neglect finding.
We believe that ACS is correct in its reading of the law. Nonetheless, we also believe it proper to emphasize that the court has the authority, in the appropriate case, and in the manner discussed below, to temper the exercise of ACS’ powers when it is directed against minor parents. For a finding of neglect is not as benign as ACS would have it. In addition, special circumstances clearly inform the relationship of a minor parent to his or her child and, of necessity, must inform the standards of conduct to which a minor parent will be held.
Thus, we agree with ACS that it is charged with the responsibility to investigate suspected acts of child abuse or neglect and to bring article 10 proceedings when it deems it appropriate. (See, e.g., Family Ct Act § 1034; Social Services Law § 397 [2] [b]; § 398 [2] [a].) The agency’s discretion in this regard is generally not to be circumscribed by a court. (See generally Matter of Lorie C., 49 NY2d 161 [1980].) And, for the reasons it has advanced, any “conflict of interest” of the type at issue arises as a necessary incident to its responsibilities. (Cf. Holtzman v Hellenbrand, 130 AD2d 749, 751 [2d Dept 1987] [reversing appointment of independent special prosecutor to act instead of District Attorney in view of alleged conflict of interest; “In view of the District Attorney’s broad discretion in determining whether and in what manner to prosecute a suspected offender, the courts will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion absent a showing of abuse”]; Matter of Johnson v Smith, 2000 WL 33389848, *1, 2000 Mich App LEXIS 334, *2-3 [Mich Ct App 2000] [“Respondent. . . also claims that the statutes governing child protective proceedings create a conflict of interest for the FIA (Family Independence Agency) because the FIA has the responsibility, at various times, of both facilitating the return of a child to the child’s parents and initiating proceedings to terminate that parent’s parental rights. We find no merit to this claim. The FIA’s responsibilities are dependent on the circumstances of each case. While those responsibilities may differ from time to time, depending on the circumstances, they do not create a conflict of interest”].)
In addition, there is nothing that expressly precludes the agency from exercising its authority in cases where a child has a minor parent. The applicable statute does not require that a respondent be an adult, simply defining the term as “includ[ing] any parent or other person legally responsible for a child’s care who is alleged to have abused or neglected such child.” (Family Ct Act § 1012 [a] [emphasis added].) In fact, while respondents suggest that a parent is absolutely barred from bringing an article 10 proceeding against his or her own child, they are incorrect. (See Family Ct Act § 1032 [b] [permitting a “person on the court’s direction” to bring a proceeding].)
There is also no authority for the proposition that the agency cannot proceed merely because the minor parent is in foster care. Indeed, in Matter of Tyriek W., the Court of Appeals, albeit in dicta, noted that if there is a concern about the care a minor parent in foster care is providing his or her child, “the supervising agency can take whatever remedial steps are necessary, including making an appropriate petition under article 10 of the Family Court Act.” (85 NY2d 774, 780 [1995].)
There are sound reasons ACS might wish to proceed in this way. When a minor parent in foster care gives birth, she retains legal custody of her child. That is, the applicable regulations make clear that even though the minor parent and child may be living together in the same foster home, the newborn is not in the legal charge of ACS. (See, e.g., 18 NYCRR 430.12 [e] [“if a minor parent is in foster care and has residing with him or her his or her child or children, and such child or children are not in the care and custody or custody and guardianship of the local commissioner of social services”]; 18 NYCRR 423.2 [c] [1] [iv] [“Family is defined ... as ... a minor parent in foster care whose child or children are residing with him or her in a foster family home or residential facility”]; see generally Matter of Tyriek W., supra; Matter of C., 160 Misc 2d 151 [Fam Ct, NY County 1994].) Accordingly, when a minor parent cannot take care of a child, it may be necessary for ACS to take steps to assert control over that child. While one may question the Legislature’s wisdom in permitting minor parents to be subjected to the process, an article 10 proceeding may provide a means to that end.
Contrary to respondents’ suggestion, a PINS proceeding would not serve equally well. Although petitioner has raised numerous arguments as to why this is so based upon the different remedial purposes of article 10 and article 7, there is a simpler rebuttal to respondents. Even if successful, an article 7 proceeding would not give ACS any greater legal rights to the newborn child than it already had by reason of the mother’s placement in foster care. Put another way, the article 7 proceeding would simply provide an alternative basis for ACS to exercise jurisdiction over the respondent parent. ACS’ goal, however, is to exercise jurisdiction over the respondent parent’s child.
Nonetheless, even though ACS has the authority to proceed against a minor parent in foster care pursuant to article 10, it should recognize that a neglect finding has a significant deleterious impact upon the parent. Among other things, it means that the report made to the state central register of child abuse and maltreatment upon which the case was based will remain on file until the 28th birthday of the youngest subject child and will not be subject to expungement. (See Family Ct Act § 1051 [f] [iii].) That imposes a stigma upon the respondent which could effectively prevent her from becoming a foster parent, adoptive parent, child care worker, or teacher. (See generally Matter of Lee TT., 87 NY2d 699 [1996].) In view of the fact that records of many serious crimes committed by a minor may be sealed or expunged (see Family Ct Act §§ 375.2, 375.3), this consequence of a neglect finding can only be considered exceptionally harsh, notwithstanding petitioner’s characterization of article 10 proceedings as “remedial, rather than punitive.” This would be particularly true if the respondent were unusually young, if the act of neglect was relatively minor, or if a lack of supervision of the respondent by her caretaker contributed to the commission of the neglectful act. (Cf. Matter of Tricia Lashawnda M., 113 Misc 2d 287 [Fam Ct, Queens County 1982] [dismissing termination proceeding based upon abandonment against minor parent in foster care where the agency obstructed regular contact between the mother and child].) Plainly, in its role of the minor’s caretaker, even if it is lawful, ACS should not wish the result to obtain under such circumstances.
As suggested by Barbara Allen’s Law Guardian here, we therefore urge ACS to consider whether it might not better serve the interests of the minor parent and the parent’s child to exercise jurisdiction over the child under the authority of Social Services Law § 398 (1), which grants it “powers” and “duties,” to “[a]ssume charge of and provide support for any destitute child who cannot be properly cared for in his home.” If effected through this authority, ACS could achieve its goal of assuming care of the minor parent’s child without necessarily tarring the minor parent with a record at the state central register.
When presented with this possibility, ACS has argued that the statutes dealing with “destitute children” are inapplicable here. We think it is mistaken.
Section 371 (3) of the Social Services Law defines a “destitute child” as
“a child who, through no neglect on the part of its parent, guardian or custodian, is
“(a) destitute or homeless, or
“(b) in a state of want or suffering due to lack of sufficient food, clothing, or shelter, or medical or surgical care, or
“(c) a person under the age of eighteen years who is absent from his legal residence without the consent of his parent, legal guardian or custodian, or
“(d) a person under the age of eighteen who is without a place of shelter where supervision and care are available.” (Emphasis added.)
ACS contends that, by definition, a subject child cannot be considered “destitute” where the minor parent has been neglectful. Plainly, however, the statute does not require that a court affirmatively determine there has been no neglectful conduct before ACS can “assume charge” of a destitute child under Social Services Law § 398. (See Matter of Anonymous v Olson, 112 AD2d 299 [2d Dept 1985] [Court affirms grant of custody of destitute child to Department of Social Services in custody proceeding without any prior finding of neglect].) Rather, ACS has the authority in the first instance to determine whether a parent’s conduct gives rise to a charge of neglect which should be brought to the court’s attention. Indeed, to the extent ACS suggests otherwise, it undermines its own persuasive arguments as to the scope of its broad discretion to decide when to commence an article 10 proceeding. (See e.g., Matter of Weber v Stony Brook Hosp., 60 NY2d 208 [1983].)
Thus, ACS routinely considers whether some exhibition of inadequate child care is “neglect” that might warrant prosecution under article 10, taking into account numerous factors, including the age of the subject child, other resources in the home, a parent’s responsiveness to proffered services, etc. — in short, all those factors that are considered when, for example, it makes “reasonable efforts” to prevent the removal of a child. (Family Ct Act § 1022.) As a result of this assessment, ACS may properly choose to make some acts of improper child care by one parent the subject of an article 10 proceeding, but decline to proceed against another parent who has committed objectively similar acts. In the instant context, should ACS conclude that the acts of the minor parent did not constitute neglect warranting the commencement of article 10 proceedings, there would be no disqualifying factor which would prevent consideration of a child as destitute under section 371. There would therefore be no obstacle to consequent invocation of ACS’ authority under section 398 to “assume charge” of that child.
Such a construct — which may operate to avoid an unnecessary neglect finding against a minor parent — is particularly appropriate because the minor parent cannot be held to the same standard of conduct as an adult. This is clear from an analysis of the principles governing the imposition of liability under article 10.
Thus, in assessing whether behavior has constituted neglect, a standard has been adopted which is familiar from the tort context: “To implement the stated purpose of article 10 proceedings, the court finds that parental behavior must be evaluated objectively. Thus, the test is whether a reasonable and prudent parent would have so acted (or failed to act) under circumstances then and there existing.” (Matter of Katherine C., 122 Misc 2d 276, 278 [Fam Ct, Richmond County 1984], cited in Matter of Christina P., 275 AD2d 783 [2d Dept 2000]; Matter of Melissa U., 148 AD2d 862 [3d Dept 1989]; see generally Besharov, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, Family Ct Act § 1012, at 317-318; cf. 79 NY Jur 2d, Negligence § 29 [“The test of actionable negligence, and consequently the measure of the required degree and standard of care, is what a reasonably prudent and careful person would have done under the circumstances in the discharge of his or her duty to the injured party” (citations omitted)].)
Critically, however, the law acknowledges that in considering “the circumstances” of the conduct being examined in a tort context, the age of the actor is a significant factor. Accordingly, “The standard of conduct to which a child must conform to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence and experience under like circumstances.” (Deliso v Cangialosi, 117 Misc 2d 105, 106 [Civ Ct, NY County 1982] [emphasis added and citations omitted]; see also Banks by Banks v United States, 969 F Supp 884, 893 [SD NY 1997] [“It has long been settled in New York that ‘an infant is expected to exercise a level of care commensurate with his age, experience, intelligence and ability’ ”], quoting Republic Ins. Co. v Michel, 885 F Supp 426, 433 [ED NY 1995], citing Camardo v New York State Rys., 247 NY 111, 116 [1928]; Sorto v Flores, 241 AD2d 446 [2d Dept 1997].) As is the case with adults, this test is likewise applicable when the lawfulness of a minor’s conduct is being evaluated in child protective proceedings.
In candor, research has failed to uncover any New York cases which expressly set forth this standard per se, although there are a number which acknowledge that accommodation must be made for a minor’s immaturity in the related context of evaluating the voluntariness of a minor parent’s surrender of a child for adoption. (See, e.g., Matter of A.F. v Spence Chapin Agency, 142 Misc 2d 412, 417 [1989] [Fam Ct, Kings County, Schechter, J.] [“The tone of (several cited) decisions serves to remind us of the need for the highest degree of care in fully informing and emotionally supporting a minor parent through every phase of the surrender process”].) However, common sense dictates this result. A minor has different capabilities and fewer options than an adult. He or she simply cannot be expected to provide the same level of care to a child, in every respect, as an adult. He or she cannot be penalized for not acting like an adult.
The Superior Court of Pennsylvania eloquently made this point in dismissing a termination proceeding brought against a minor parent:
“In the case at bar, two of the goals which appellant was faulted for failing to achieve were the establishment of independent living arrangements and finding employment to support herself and her son. It is questionable whether a just society should require a minor parent to emancipate him or herself as a condition for forestalling the termination of such minor’s parental rights. The feasibility of goals of this nature should be examined when a court is ruling on a termination petition. As an example, we refer to the fact that minors can be employed only in jobs that meet the strictures set forth in the child labor laws. The record shows that appellant did make an effort to meet the goals demanded of her and, in view of her age at the time, we find that her lack of success in this area cannot be greatly weighed against her.” (Matter of Adoption of Barnett, 304 Pa Super 514, 526, 450 A2d 1356, 1362 [1982] [emphasis added].)
Plainly, the same reasoning has force in the instant context.
We are not in any way suggesting that a minor is immune from article 10 proceedings because of his or her age, or because he or she is in foster care. As we discussed above, the Legislature has determined to make minor parents subject to such proceedings. On many occasions, a minor parent’s conduct will be sufficiently egregious under the applicable standard to warrant the commencement of a proceeding and a finding by the court. However, there will likely be other occasions where consideration of the age and circumstances of the minor parent will lead ACS to conclude that the parent has not committed acts of neglect. In those cases, if the parent cannot otherwise care for the child, ACS may assume the child’s care under the authority of Social Services Law § 398.
Of course, when ACS does bring an article 10 proceeding against a minor, as it has here, it will be the court’s obligation to determine under the foregoing standards whether the case has been proven. And again, in those circumstances where neglect or abuse is not proved, but the minor parent cannot care for the child, recourse to section 398 may be available. As is the case with the matters at hand, any such determination by the court must await the conclusion of fact-finding.
C. Conclusion
Respondents’ motion is denied.
. A third case originally consolidated for purposes of this motion, Matter of D.E., was subsequently withdrawn.
. Substantive proceedings in the underlying case have been held in abeyance during the pendency of this motion.
. The direction to consolidate these cases for purposes of this motion was made at a conference held on January 8, 2003, when a briefing schedule was also set. On February 11, 2003, before the motion was actually filed, ACS filed a supplemental petition against the respondent, raising the additional claim that the mother abused cocaine to the point that on January 8, 2003 she had to be hospitalized after passing out.
. All three children are in the same foster home.
. That Disciplinary Rule provides that, unless there is a knowing consent by both clients after full disclosure of its implications, an attorney may not accept multiple employment “if the exercise of independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by tbe acceptance of the proffered employment, or if it would be likely to involve the lawyer in representing differing interests.” (DR 5-105 [a].) DR 5-105 (b) sets forth a proscription on continuing employment in such circumstances.
. ACS is represented by attorneys employed in the agency’s Division of Legal Services, who serve as Special Assistant Corporation Counsels.
. “ ‘Parens patriae,’ literally ‘parent of the country,’ refers traditionally to [the] role of state as sovereign and guardian of persons under legal disability, such as juveniles or the insane . . . It is the principle that the state must care for those who cannot take care of themselves, such as minors who lack proper care and custody from their parents.” (Black’s Law Dictionary 1114 [6th ed] [citations omitted].)
. This structure is consistent with the view that a minor parent maintains custody of his or her own child, even though the parent remains in the custody of her parent or guardian. One writer has argued persuasively that the failure to restrict a minor parent’s custodial rights is unfortunate. Among other things, a minor parent has deficient decision-making skills because of age, which might serve to put the newborn at risk. In addition, it undermines the relationship between the minor parent and his or her own parent. And, it has the potentially bizarre consequence of permitting a minor parent to make medical decisions on the newborn’s behalf even though the parent cannot make them on his or her own. (Buss, The Parental Rights of Minors, 48 Buff L Rev 785 [Fall 2000].)
. ACS has also objected to utilization of section 398 on the ground that it is not permitted to assert jurisdiction over a destitute subject child unless it terminates the parent’s rights under section 384-b. ACS plainly misconstrues the statutory scheme. While section 384-b sets forth a procedure which may be utilized for assuming care of a destitute child in certain circumstances, including the death of his or her parents, it in no way requires utilization of that procedure if ACS merely wishes to “assume charge” of a destitute child under section 398. This is clear from a comparison of the first two subdivisions of section 398. The first, dealing exclusively with destitute children, authorizes ACS to “[a]ssume charge” and “provide support” for such children, and makes no mention whatsoever of any attendant court proceedings. (Social Services Law § 398 [1].) By contrast, subdivision (2), dealing with “neglected, abused or abandoned children,” expressly contemplates the prosecution of proceedings in Family Court “to obtain custody” of such children (§ 398 [2] [a]), and “adjudication by such court of the alleged neglect, abuse or abandonment.” (§ 398 [2] [b]; see also § 397.) In any event, the Second Department has expressly approved of the appropriate agency’s assumption of custody of a destitute child where a parent’s rights were not terminated. (See Matter of Anonymous v Olson, supra.)
. Respondents have also moved to dismiss the proceedings under Family-Court Act § 1051 (c) on the ground that the aid of the court is allegedly not required. That motion is denied with leave to renew during the dispositional ■phases of these proceedings, if and when they are reached.",0
0475-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
John J. Connell, J.
The defendant is indicted on charges of assault, first and second degrees, vehicular assault, second degree, reckless endangerment, first degree, grand larceny, fourth degree, criminal possession of stolen property, third degree, leaving the scene of an incident, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, third degree, and driving while ability impaired. A mistrial was declared on May 21, 2003 when the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Pending the retrial, the defendant was returned to a state correctional facility on a sentence unrelated to this indictment.
On July 21, 2003 the defendant’s attorney, Brian Shulman, and Assistant District Attorney Richard Roxin, who is in charge of the prosecution of this case, informed me that Mr. Terry sent a letter addressed to Mr. Shulman, but bearing the street address of the District Attorney’s office. The letter was opened by a secretary/receptionist in the District Attorney’s office. She made a determination, based on the familiarity of the defendant’s name, that it was Assistant District Attorney Rodeman’s case. Mr. Rodeman was trial counsel before it was reassigned to Mr. Roxin for the retrial. She forwarded the letter to Mr. Rode-man who read it and passed it on to Mr. Roxin. Two copies were made of the letter and retained by the District Attorney’s office. The original was forwarded to Mr. Shulman.
The defendant sent a second letter to the District Attorney’s office addressed to Mr. Shulman. Again it was opened apparently by a secretary/receptionist who informed Mr. Rodeman that it had not been removed from its envelope. It was sealed and passed on to Mr. Roxin, who forwarded the original to Mr. Shulman.
On July 21 this court directed the District Attorney to seal and forward their copies to me, and retain no other copy of the letters. Mr. Roxin assured court and defense counsel that he would not use any information at Mr. Terry’s retrial which was gained from reviewing the letters.
Nonetheless, the defendant requested the appointment of a Special Prosecutor pursuant to County Law § 701, citing the District Attorney’s improper review of the letters, which he asserts contain privileged information. The District Attorney opposed that request on several grounds: that fairly new employees had opened the letters; that it was understandable that mail addressed to Mr. Shulman would be opened by staff since he had once been an assistant district attorney, albeit several years ago; and that the letter read by Mr. Rodeman “was largely unintelligible. We gained nothing from it” (transcript of Aug. 22, 2003 proceedings at 10).
With the permission of both parties, this court has reviewed in camera the two original letters and both copies of the first letter. The first letter is postmarked June 16, 2003. The return address on the front of the envelope reads:
“LIVINGSTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
“EO. Box 1991, Route 36 Sonyea Road
“Sonyea, New York 14556
“NAME: Roy Terry (handwritten) DIN: 02B2030 (handwritten).”
“Legal mail” is handwritten in the lower right and lower left corners of the envelope. The front of the envelope also bears a “Star” symbol postal stamp, printed in red ink, which reads as follows:
“LIVINGSTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
“ROUTE, 36, SONYEA ROAD
“SONYEA, NY 14556.”
The return address on the back flap of the envelope reads:
“NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES
“INMATE CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAM
“NAME: Roy Terry (handwritten) DIN: 02B2030 (handwritten)
“Legal mail (handwritten).”
The second letter, which the District Attorney apparently did not copy, was postmarked July 7, 2003. It bears the following return address on the front of the envelope:
“LIVINGSTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
“EO. Box 1991, Route 36 Sonyea Road
“Sonyea, New York 14556
“NAME: Roy Terry (handwritten) DIN: 02B2030 (handwritten).”
“law firm legal mail“ is handwritten in the lower right corner of the envelope. It also bears the “Star” postal stamp and return address, printed in red ink, as follows:
“LIVINGSTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
“ROUTE, 36, SONYEA ROAD
“SONYEA, NY 14556.”
The return address on the back flap of the envelope reads:
“NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES
“INMATE CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAM
“NAME: Roy Terry (handwritten) DIN: 02B2030 (handwritten).”
The attorney-client privilege “exists to insure that one seeking legal advice will be able to confide fully and freely in his attorney, secure in the knowledge that his confidences will not later be exposed to public view to his embarrassment or legal detriment” (Matter of Priest v Hennessy, 51 NY2d 62, 67-68 [1980]). The attorney-client privilege and issues surrounding its waiver are particularly important in criminal cases (People v Cassas, 84 NY2d 718 [1995]).
A waiver is the “intentional relinquishment ... of a known right” (Johnson v Zerbst, 304 US 458, 464 [1938]). While it is the burden of the proponent of the privilege to show that the privilege was not waived, formal motions are not necessary to raise the issue. Courts have held that a simple objection expressed in a letter from the client’s attorney is sufficient to bring the matter before a court for that determination (Blair Communications v Reliance Capital Group, 182 AD2d 578 [1992]). For purposes of this application, the July 21 conference sufficiently raised the issue.
Appellate cases on this subject generally involve inadvertent disclosure of documents contained in hundreds of pages of materials that were intentionally mailed to the opponent in the pretrial discovery stages of civil cases. In determining whether there was a waiver of the attorney-client privilege concerning those documents, courts have looked at the subjective intent of the client.
“Two other factors to be considered in assessing whether an inadvertent disclosure waives the privilege are whether there was a prompt objection to the disclosure after discovering it and whether the party claiming waiver will suffer prejudice if a protective order is granted” (Baliva v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 275 AD2d 1030, 1032 [2000]; Kraus v Brandstetter, 185 AD2d 300 [1992]; Blair, supra at 578; Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co. v Servotronics, Inc., 132 AD2d 392 [1987]; see also, New York Times Newspaper Div. of N.Y. Times Co. v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, 300 AD2d 169 [2002]).
Courts examining the client’s subjective intent have generally held that inadvertent disclosure of such materials does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege (6340 Tr. Rd. v Unigard Sec., 209 AD2d 922 [4th Dept 1994]). Commenting on inadvertent disclosures, the American Bar Association has stated that a “lawyer who receives materials that on their face appeared to be subject to the attorney-client privilege or otherwise confidential, under circumstances where it is clear they were not intended for the receiving lawyer, should refrain from examining the materials, notify the sending lawyer and abide by the instructions of the lawyer who sent them” (ABA Formal Op 92-368). That opinion is based on the premise that inadvertent disclosure of otherwise privileged material does not constitute a waiver and further suggests that the receiving party serves in the position of a constructive bailee, with a legal duty to return the document to opposing counsel (Rogers, New Insights on Waiver and the Inadvertent Disclosure of Privileged Materials: Attorney Responsibility as the Governing Precept, 47 Fla L Rev 159).
Indeed, there is authority for not only suppressing improperly obtained privileged information at trial, but also disqualifying counsel who obtained the information (Matter of Beiny, 129 AD2d 126 [1987], rearg denied 132 AD2d 190 [1987], appeal dismissed 71 NY2d 994 [1988]; Matter of Kochovos, 140 AD2d 180 [1988]; CPLR 3103, 4503).
As stated above, most of the reported cases involve privileged materials included in documents intentionally turned over to the opposing side in a civil lawsuit. The Court of Appeals, however, decided a case with a factual setting more similar to the instant matter. In Lipin v Bender (193 AD2d 424 [1993], affd 84 NY2d 562 [1994]), the defendant brought privileged documents to a pretrial discovery proceeding and left them at counsel table where the plaintiff customarily sat. The top sheet of the documents bore the name of the defendant’s attorney and the words “File Memo.” The plaintiff read and copied the papers, and failed to return them to defense counsel.
The plaintiffs attorney maintained that since the materials were left at the plaintiffs seat at the table, they were obtained “legitimately,” that there was no inadvertent disclosure, and therefore, the defendant had waived the privilege. The trial court, after reviewing all the circumstances, took the extreme remedy of dismissing the plaintiffs complaint, finding the plaintiffs and her attorney’s actions “egregious.” The Appellate Division and Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court and held the privilege was not waived by leaving the documents at a pretrial disclosure conference, notwithstanding their being left at the very seat of the plaintiff.
It is clear that in this case Mr. Terry’s attorney-client privilege was breached by the prosecutor’s review of at least one of the letters in question. It may be understandable that a clerical staff member could in good faith open the first letter sent by the defendant. (However, it perhaps points to the need for office procedural improvements to more carefully identify the addressee before correspondence is opened. This point is made more obvious by the office’s opening of the second letter after having been alerted to their first mistake.)
What is more difficult to understand is the reading (or “scanning” as the prosecutor later characterized) of that letter by the Assistant District Attorney who had time to examine the numerous envelope markings identifying defense counsel and the defendant by name, identifying the correctional facility from which the letter was sent and identifying the letter as “Legal Mail.” The error in judgment was compounded by making multiple copies and retaining them.
An examination of the letters by this court discloses nothing in the July 7 letter that would prejudice the defendant’s retrial even if they were read by the prosecutor. It simply requested copies of transcripts to be forwarded to the defendant.
The June 16 letter, however, contains several clear references to both the criminal and civil cases related to this indictment. The letter, while certainly not literary prose, is anything but “unintelligible” as described by the prosecutor. The defendant highlights discrepancies in the arresting officer’s statement and grand jury testimony, calls into question her physical description of the suspect, and cites the lack of physical evidence in the case. References are made to a proposed motion to dismiss as well as physical threats allegedly received by the defendant which relate to this case. Most significant, however, is the defendant’s explanation for his own injuries at the scene of his arrest. This latter issue was very relevant during the first trial.
On July 21 the prosecutor promised not to use any information obtained from the letters. That may be a difficult assurance to fulfill, but in lieu of appointing a Special Prosecutor, this court will hold him to that pledge. If the People have questions about what areas they are precluded from pursuing, they should seek guidance from the court outside the presence of the jury or before commencement of the trial. Failure to do so runs the risk of a mistrial with prejudice and ultimate dismissal of the indictment.
Accordingly, the defendant’s application for the appointment of a Special Prosecutor pursuant to County Law § 701 is in all respects denied.",0
0417-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Philip S. Straniere, J.
Claimant, Frank Kinkopf, commenced this small claims action against the defendant, E-Z Pass New York Service Center, alleging that the defendant had wrongfully charged claimant’s E-Z Pass account for trips not taken. A trial was held on June 5, 2003. Claimant represented himself. Defendant was represented by counsel. Defendant notified the court that the proper defendant is the Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Authority (TBTA) and not E-Z Pass. The caption was amended to reflect the name of the proper defendant.
Background:
E-Z Pass is a registered service mark of an entity which has entered into contracts with various states, including New York, to provide electronic toll collection services on bridges, tunnels and highways. E-Z Pass itself is not a corporation registered to do business in the State of New York. E-Z Pass has been selected as the name for the toll collection system adopted by a consortium of toll agencies in the northeast of the United States including New York. There are two different electronic toll collection systems, “read-only” and “read-write.” “Read-only” systems scan for information on a transponder (tag) affixed to a vehicle windshield and is designed for use primarily at bridges, tunnels and toll barriers which are uniform. “Read-write” systems have the capability to take the information from the tag and adjust the account balance between entry and exit on a toll road.
The customer agreement that the claimant signed, as well as a document containing the format of that agreement as of February 2001, were both submitted into evidence as exhibits by the defendant. Claimant applied for and was issued two separate tags in 1996. Claimant’s application is signed March 27, 1996, yet the page attached as a copy of the “E-Z Pass Customer Agreement Terms and Conditions” states, “These are new private account E-Z Pass Terms and Conditions, dated May 2001. These Terms and Conditions supercede all previous Terms and Conditions you may have received.” Quite obviously the terms and conditions of the original agreement are not part of the record. Defendant has provided a subsequent updated agreement as an attachment to claimant’s 1996 application. Defendant is asserting that the application of March 1996 can be and has been unilaterally altered by the defendant generating a new page of terms and conditions.
Paragraph 10 of the current agreement states: “Modifications. E-Z Pass may change the terms of the Agreement at any time by advance written notice. You agree to new terms when you use the Tag subsequent to the effective date of the new term. The invalidity of any terms of this Agreement shall not affect any other term of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.” Although defendant has not shown that it ever gave written notice of changes in the agreement to the claimant, the evidence establishes that the claimant did in fact use his tag numerous times after May 2001, thereby, according to the terms of the agreement, binding the claimant to those terms. The evidence also establishes that in April 2002 new tags were issued to the claimant and he continued to use them until he cancelled his account in May 2003. In addition to not establishing any written notice to the claimant of any changes in the agreement, there is also no evidence as to what were the terms of the 1996 agreement and what terms, if any, were changed over the course of five years. There is no testimony as to any differences between the February 2001 application and agreement and that of May 2001.
Paragraph 11 of the agreement provides that the agreement “shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.” Paragraph 3 (f) provides that “You may contest the imposition of charges or administrative fees only in writing to the E-Z Pass Customer Service Center. Such challenge must be made within 180 days from the date of the transaction.”
Nowhere in the agreement other than the “challenge” in paragraph 11 is there any description of the process to be followed should a customer want to file a claim against E-Z Pass or commence a civil action. The only reference is that cited above requiring sending a letter to the E-Z Pass Service Center. Nowhere in the agreement is E-Z Pass as an entity described. Does it have its own existence as a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other legal entity? Nowhere in the agreement is there an explanation as to why the TBTA is defending this action and not E-Z Pass.
Issues Presented:
A. Who is the Proper Defendant?
Claimant, a Staten Island resident, on March 27, 1996, contracted with the defendant to become a participant in the “MTA Bridges and Tunnels” E-Z Pass account program. There is no separate public authority named the “MTA Bridges and Tunnels Authority.” The 1996 application, in extremely small print at the bottom, below the body of the form, indicates that “MTA Bridges and Tunnels is a name of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.” Such a notation does not exist on the February 2001 application. There is no evidence, nor was there any testimony, as to whether the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PA of NY&NJ), New York State Bridge Authority (NYSBA) or New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), the other entities that offer E-Z Pass as a toll collection method in New York State, had generated their own application at that time as had the TBTA. The latest application used by E-Z Pass is generic in nature and does not specify any particular agency as contracting with the customer. The agreement contained no explanation nor was any offered at trial, as to how a customer is to assert a claim questioning charges assessed by E-Z Pass through one of these agencies either arising from use of the facilities of the issuing agency or from the facilities of another entity. The uniform application currently in use does not indicate to which one of the participating authorities the applicant’s account will be assigned. The fact that the contract will be between the applicant and the entity to which the account is assigned is set forth in the agreement, not the application.
The TBTA is an agency created by the Legislature pursuant to title 3 of article 3 of the Public Authorities Law and exists separate and apart from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) which was formed pursuant to title 11 of article 5 of the Public Authorities Law. The labeling of the application as including the “MTA Bridges and Tunnels” is confusing to say the least. It leads to the conclusion that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is the proper agency to be involved and not the Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Authority. Although the governing board of these authorities is identical (Public Authorities Law § 552), which agency is the proper defendant may have significant consequences. If claimant’s cause of action is deemed to be based in tort, such an action against the TBTA requires that a notice of claim have been filed (Public Authorities Law § 569-a [2]); whereas if the TBTA is a “subsidiary corporation” of the MTA, no notice of claim is needed (Public Authorities Law § 1276 [6]). If the MTA itself is the proper defendant in a tort action then the notice of claim must be filed as set forth in General Municipal Law § 50-e (Public Authorities Law § 1276 [2]).
This discrepancy in procedure requires an analysis of a customer’s right of action against each of these entities.
1. TBTA.
A notice of claim must be filed within six months of the accrual of the cause of action. A claimant must allow 30 days to elapse after the filing of the notice of claim before an action can be commenced (Public Authorities Law § 569-a). A tort action must be commenced one year after the cause of action accrued. There is no notice of claim required for contract actions.
2. MTA.
The notice of claim must be filed within 90 days of the event, and 30 days must elapse after a claim is filed before an action can be started (Public Authorities Law § 1276; General Municipal Law § 50-e). A tort action must be commenced within one year of the accrual of the cause of action. There is no notice of claim for contract actions.
3. MTA Subsidiary.
The same rules as apply to the MTA apply to subsidiary corporations except no notice of claim is required.
4. PA of NY&NJ.
If an action is commenced against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a notice of claim is required as a condition precedent to “any suit, action or proceeding” whether tort or contract (McKinney’s Uncons Laws of NY § 7107; L 1950, ch 301, § 7). However, in addition to being a condition precedent to any suit, 60 days must pass before a lawsuit can be commenced and such a lawsuit must be commenced within one year of the accrual of the cause of action. The statute does not require the notice of claim to be filed within a specific time except that the notice of intention to sue must be served in sufficient time so as to commence that action within the one-year statute of limitations.
.5. NYSBA.
Tort actions against the New York State Bridge Authority, like actions against the TBTA, require a notice of claim to be filed (Public Authorities Law § 540); however, actions against the NYSBA have to be filed within 90 days of the cause of action accruing while those against the TBTA are to be commenced within six months of the event. The action must be commenced within one year and 90 days. The 30-day period staying commencement of the action after filing the notice of claim applies. There is no notice of claim required for contract actions.
6. NYSTA.
Actions against the New York State Thruway Authority for a tort or breach of contract must be brought in the Court of Claims (Public Authorities Law § 361-b) and the procedures of the Court of Claims Act must be followed (Court of Claims Act art 2). In a negligence action the Court of Claims Act requires the filing of a claim (the equivalent of commencing a civil action) within 90 days of the event unless the claimant files a notice of intention to file a claim, then the claimant has two years to commence a lawsuit. In a contract action a claim (cause of action) must be filed within six months; however, if the claimant files a notice of intention to file a claim then the claimant has two years to commence a lawsuit. There is no period providing for a stay in the statute.
If a customer’s rights are to be determined by which entity is managing the E-Z Pass account and each entity has different procedural practices, access to the courts is not being applied uniformly. E-Z Pass is held out to be a statewide program. Procedural rights are not based on the fact that an individual is a New York State citizen, but on the ministerial act of either the customer selecting a convenient E-Z Pass issuing authority or being assigned to one based on some other criteria such as presumably where the applicant lives in New York. In this case claimant’s application is on an “MTA Bridges and Tunnels” form, whereas defendant’s exhibit of the current application being used lists none of the named authorities as the contracting party on behalf of E-Z Pass. A customer is left bound by the nebulous terms of the preamble to the agreement that “your account will be assigned to one of the abovementioned New York entities.”
Paragraph 11 of the customer agreement provides that the “Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.” Unfortunately, as pointed out above, that is not a consistent standard. The law to be applied will be determined by the agency to which the contract is assigned. This practice cannot continue to be the case. Although the Legislature only approved electronic toll collection methods and is not involved in the negotiation or approval of the terms of the contracts, the Legislature has an obligation to act to ensure that all New York customers are protected by the same rules and regulations. This can be done by requiring that certain language be included in the E-Z Pass contracts or by establishing a uniform set of procedures to govern disputes between customers and the E-Z Pass management.
The Legislature has clearly and strongly stated its disdain for administrative procedures that lack uniformity. In its statement of legislative intent in passing the State Administrative Procedure Act, it said:
“The legislature hereby finds and declares that the administrative rulemaking, adjudicatory and licensing processes among the agencies of state government are inconsistent, lack uniformity and create misunderstanding by the public. In order to provide the people with simple, uniform administrative procedures, an administrative procedure act is hereby enacted. This act guarantees that the actions of administrative agencies conform with sound standards developed in this state and nation since their founding through constitutional, statutory and case law. It ensures that equitable practices will be provided to meet the public interest.” (State Administrative Procedure Act § 100.)
Three of the four agencies currently providing E-Z Pass are subject to the State Administrative Procedure Act since they all contain members appointed by the Governor (State Administrative Procedure Act § 102 [1]). The Port Authority may be excluded because it is created by interstate compact even though the Governor appoints members. The Thruway Authority has been held to be an agency subject to the act (Loyal Tire & Auto Ctr. v New York State Thruway Auth., 227 AD2d 82 [3d Dept 1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 804 [1997]). Since the TBTA and NYSBA are similarly constituted as described, they would also be subject to the State Administrative Procedure Act.
If the State Administrative Procedure Act in its entirety applies to these agencies and the E-Z Pass program, then this court would lack the jurisdiction to hear these disputes since the State Administrative Procedure Act would seem to require that an administrative hearing take place pursuant to article 3 of that statute. As an administrative determination, a CPLR article 78 proceeding would be the judicial remedy available thereafter to any dissatisfied party. One of the factors to be considered in that analysis would be whether or not the claim is excluded under State Administrative Procedure Act § 102 (2). There is insufficient evidence before this court to resolve the issue of whether or not the State Administrative Procedure Act is applicable, although the defendant did not assert this as a defense to the claim.
B. Is This a Tort or Contract Action?
In order to properly adjudicate this dispute, it must be decided if the claimant is alleging damages arising from defendant’s commission of a tort or breach of contract, since different procedural issues will be triggered by the classification of the action. How the claim was pleaded is not dispositive of this issue since it is a small claims proceeding and the complaint only contains a general statement as to the basis of the claim (UCCA 1803). Claimant contends that E-Z Pass had been deducting too much money from his account each month. He had authorized the procedure of an automatic charge to his credit card account. E-Z Pass may be prepaid by either cash, credit card, check or money order. The prepaid amount is credited to the customer’s account. A deduction from the account is made each time the tag is used. When the sum prepaid declines to a certain amount as set forth in the agreement another payment is due from the customer in order to continue to use the system. When a credit card is used an automatic deduction is made by E-Z Pass when the replenishment threshold is reached. Claimant submitted a printout from defendant showing deductions between March 2, 2003 and April 29, 2003 of $350. Claimant is seeking $3,000 in damages, asserting that the incorrect billings and deductions go back for a longer period of time than as shown in the evidence he presented at the trial. If claimant is alleging that defendant was negligent in maintaining the account then the action would sound in tort. If the claimant is asserting that the defendant breached the contract by charging him for trips he did not take, the claim is a contract action.
If classified as a tort action, the claimant’s cause of action would have to be dismissed since he did not file a notice of claim as required by the Public Authorities Law as a prerequisite to pursuing an action against the TBTA (Public Authorities Law § 569-a [2]). It is implied in the agreement that the defendant has contracted to accurately calculate the number of trips used by a particular vehicular tag and to properly bill it to a customer’s account. Claimant contends that the defendant improperly charged his account for trips he did not take. This is not a breach of contract action. He is alleging that the system did not operate properly, with the defendant being negligent in operating the system, not that defendant breached his contract. A breach of contract action might be one where the customer contends that payment has been made, yet defendant failed to properly credit the account or one where the defendant prevented the customer from using one of the facilities when sufficient monies were present in the account. Breach of contract would also exist if the defendant billed the customer an administrative fee for not having a sufficient balance when that was not the case.
If this is a breach of contract action then the claimant’s cause of action would be viable under a common-law breach of contract theory. No notice of claim would have had to have been filed in such a case against the TBTA.
It must be concluded that claimant’s action is one sounding in negligence and therefore must be dismissed for his failure to file a notice of claim as required by the Public Authorities Law. However, since Public Authorities Law § 569-a gives a claimant six months in which to file a notice of claim, the claimant still has time to file such a notice and recommence the action for charges made in 2003.
C. Has the Statute of Limitations Run?
Defendant has argued that paragraph 3 (f) of the agreement creates a statute of limitations of 180 days for any and all causes of action against E-Z Pass. The court cannot agree that the clause is a “statute of limitations” nor does it contractually reduce the statute of limitations established by the Legislature applicable to the action. If claimant is asserting a common-law breach of contract action, the statute of limitations is six years (CPLR 213); if it is a common-law negligence action, the limitations period is three years (CPLR 214); if this is a claim against one of the agencies listed above, then depending on which authority is involved, the period of limitations is as short as one year as is set forth in the legislation creating the particular entity.
Parties to a contract by written agreement may agree to reduce the statute of limitations (CPLR 201; Kassner & Co. v City of New York, 46 NY2d 544 [1979]). It is assumed that when such a term is in a contract, it has been voluntarily agreed to and will be binding on the parties unless there is a showing that the time is unreasonably short, or the clause was entered into as a result of duress, fraud or misrepresentation (Incorporated Vil. of Saltaire v Zagata, 280 AD2d 547 [2d Dept 2001]). For the clause in question to be an attempt to shorten the applicable statute of limitations, the language of the agreement would have to either label the paragraph with the words “statute of limitations” or something similar such as “right to assert claims” or contain such words in the paragraph explaining that the normal time frame to commence litigation or assert a cause of action had been reduced. No such language is contained in the paragraph. The paragraph in question does not even use the word “claim,” it merely informs a customer that he or she has to “challenge” any imposition of charges or administrative fees within six months of the transaction in question. Owing to the fact that the defendant prepared this agreement and that a customer is not permitted to negotiate the terms of the contract, it can only be concluded that the drafter either did not intend to treat this paragraph as a reduction of the “statute of limitations” or purposefully used language that might be subject to varying interpretations. The court cannot conclude that the language is “ambiguous” so as to result in a presumption against the drafter. It seems clear that if the defendant intended to shorten the statute of limitations language to achieve that effect should have been used. It was not.
The above being said, does the paragraph create a condition precedent to be met before a claim can be filed or a suit commenced? As set forth above, if a customer’s action has to be commenced against one of the governmental authorities discussed herein, a notice of claim must be filed prior to suit. A notice of claim is generally considered to be a condition precedent to suit (Yonkers Contr. Co. v Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 93 NY2d 375 [1999]). If this clause is a contractual “notice of claim,” it would alter the notice of claim procedures set forth in the statutes. For claims against some of the authorities, this paragraph would be extending the statutory claim period from 90 days to 180 days.
In general, statutes of limitations in contract actions cannot be extended. This is done to protect consumers from having to enter into agreements, where as a condition to entering a contract, the consumer must waive the defense of statute of limitations. The General Obligations Law does permit extension of the period by agreement after, not before, the cause of action arises (General Obligations Law § 17-103). On the contrary if this paragraph is an extension of the notice of claim period, it would be “pro” consumer since it would be providing a greater period of time in which to seek resolution of disputes.
In order to qualify this paragraph as a “notice of claim,” the contract should contain specific words to that effect. It does not. Asserting a “challenge” to a charge is not the same as the requirement to file a notice of claim as a condition precedent to suit.
“Case law distinguishes between a Statute of Limitations and a statutory time restriction on commencement of suit. The former merely suspends the remedy provided by a right of action, but the latter conditions the existence of a right of action, thereby creating a substantive limitation on the right” (Yonkers Contr. Co. v Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., supra at 378 [citations omitted]). The language of this clause fits neither description.
There is of course one situation where this clause would make sense, that is, if the proper defendant is the private entity known as E-Z Pass and not the governmental authorities as asserted by the defendant herein. If E-Z Pass is the proper defendant, then by contract the customer and E-Z Pass could require any “challenge” to a charge to be filed within 180 days. The contract could require that such a challenge be a condition precedent to be complied with by a customer prior to commencing either a common-law breach of contract or tort suit. Such a conclusion saves this clause from being a nullity and unenforceable as being in direct conflict with the claims procedure for each agency. It also gives some logical sense to the remaining paragraphs of the agreement. Unfortunately there is absolutely no evidence from which it can be concluded that E-Z Pass is a legal entity capable of being sued in its own name.
There is no evidence that the claimant complied with the 180-day clause of the contract. Although the clause does not discuss the ability of the customer to commence a cause of action against E-Z Pass, the parties can by contract incorporate into their agreement a clause that would give E-Z Pass the opportunity to investigate challenges to billings before a customer could commence a suit. The court will not deal with the issue of whether or not this “Agreement” is an adhesion contract and to what degree, if any, a customer can negotiate the terms of the agreement. Although the court somehow doubts that the customer can negotiate any of the terms of the agreement beyond what appears in the standard form.
The fact remains that the clause exists in the contract and the customer did not establish that prior to commencing this lawsuit he gave the defendant an opportunity to investigate his complaints and resolve the issue. That right is a condition precedent to commencing an action for the relief sought herein and requires the dismissal of this action without prejudice to renew upon proving that a “challenge” was filed in writing and rejected by the defendant.
Interestingly the Legislature has established a procedure for those situations when the public authority that operates a toll highway bridge or tunnel facility wants to collect a.toll from the owner of a vehicle who used a facility without tendering the proper payment (Public Authorities Law § 2985). A notice of liability must be served upon the customer by mail within 30 days of the violation (Public Authorities Law § 2985 [7]). In these situations the rules of the public authority serving the notice of liability on the customer apply and the matter will be heard in the county where the violation occurred or in New York City and with the consent of both parties in any county in New York City where the public authority maintains a facility (Public Authorities Law § 2985 [8]). No such simplified procedure is in place for the customer to challenge the imposition of a toll.
D. Did the Claimant Prove a Prima Facie Case?
Claimant has the burden of proof. He is alleging that neither he nor any member of his family used either of the two E-Z Pass devices issued to him on the days and times set forth in the bills defendant sent him. Claimant testified that at the times in question he had E-Z Pass units for two vehicles. An examination of the usage records indicates that these devices were being used in vehicles maintained not only by the TBTA and the PA of NY&NJ, but also by the State of New Jersey through the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. These records fail to reveal that any of the tolls were double billed or that the time of each activation would have been impossible based on the distance traveled and the hour of recording. Rather than provide any documentation to support his contention such as showing that his vehicles were elsewhere at those times and places, claimant offers the Bob Dylan “It Ain’t Me, Babe” plea. Claimant has no proof that defendant’s equipment was operating incorrectly. He has no proof his vehicles were inoperable on the dates in question. In an effort to disprove claimant’s contentions, defendant provided, in addition to testimony, detailed records of the tag use of claimant’s vehicles including photographs of the cars passing through toll booths at some of the facilities. The defendant’s records show that during the period November 1, 2002 to May 4, 2003, claimant was billed $587 for usage of the tags. The billing was apparently done in conformity with the terms of the “Agreement.” There is no evidence to establish that the billings are inaccurate.
Even if all of the procedural issues were resolved in favor of the claimant, the case must be dismissed. There is no credible evidence to establish that the claimant was improperly billed by the defendant.
E. Did the Defendant Violate General Business Law § 349?
General Business Law § 349 defines deceptive acts and unlawful practices in relation to consumer contracts. It provides “(a) Deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in the state are hereby declared unlawful.” A review of the contract between the E-Z Pass and the claimant leads to the conclusion that the contract as drawn constitutes a deceptive practice. This statute is applicable to the situation since the claimant is a “consumer” and E-Z Pass, whether a private entity or a governmental activity, is engaged in the business of toll collection. The deceptive practices are as follows.
First, there is no legal entity in the State of New York known as “E-Z Pass.” A search of New York filings reveals no such entity conducting business in New York State. That being the case, the contract with consumers must state who or what is “E-Z Pass.” If it is only a registered service mark, as all of its published material indicates that it is, then the contract must specify who or what entity holds the service mark. This is not disclosed anywhere. Through its advertising and promotion the general public has been led to believe that “E-Z Pass” is the entity with which it is contracting. It is unlikely that the public can discern the small “SM” after the words “E-Z Pass” or understands what is the significance of that designation. Since public authorities are involved in this endeavor, the public has the right to know with whom it is dealing when subscribing to the program.
Second, there is no entity defined in the “Agreement” with the customer as being the other contracting party. The application/agreement lists four New York State agencies that participate in the E-Z Pass “multi-state system of electronic financial transaction,” yet the contract does not set forth which authority is actually contracting with the customer. The contract does not specify how a customer’s account is assigned to a particular authority. As a result the customer has no guidance as to which agency should be a party to any suit. This failure to disclose the proper agency can affect the issue of where is the proper venue of any action. The place of trial of an action against a public authority shall be in the county in which the authority has its principal office or where it has facilities involved in the action (CPLR 505). Since the contracting authority is not disclosed in the agreement, where is the customer supposed to commence a suit? Suppose that the claimant in this case was only challenging the tolls incurred on the New Jersey Turnpike, what right would he have to commence an action in New York against that entity? The agreement does not distinguish between charges incurred in New York and those incurred outside the state and why redress is permitted in the New York courts against out-of-state E-Z Pass participants. In contrast to this lack of guidance as to where a consumer should sue one of these authorities, the Legislature has specifically fixed the jurisdiction and venue for actions by one of these authorities when an individual fails to pay a toll (Public Authorities Law § 2985; McKinney’s Uncons Laws of NY § 6816-c; L 1992, ch 379, § 4).
Third, although one of the entities is called the MTA Bridges and Tunnels, no such authority exists; it is in fact a name used by the TBTA. Public Authorities Law § 551 (9), which deals with the TBTA, defines “metropolitan transportation authority” as the “corporation created by section twelve hundred sixty-three of this chapter.” So a consumer who by chance identifies the MTA Bridges and Tunnels as the agency that is servicing his or her account would logically believe that an action should be brought against the MTA and not the TBTA. However, such a belief would be incorrect as the MTA is not a participating authority in the toll collection enterprise. This on its face is confusing and deceptive.
Fourth, the fact that an account may be assigned to any of the four agencies and each agency has its own procedure for filing claims against it, creates due process and equal protection of the law issues. Should not the same procedure uniformly be utilized for claims against E-Z Pass arising in the State of New York? How can there potentially be four different procedures to be invoked when the customer believes he or she is contracting with only one entity known as E-Z Pass? To uphold the current system, each contract would have to be with the specific designated agency, rather than with E-Z Pass, with that fact being made known to the consumer. When I was a child my cousin would come and visit from Brooklyn; we would often play games such as “knock-hockey” and “stoop” ball. Invariably I would lose when he would invoke “Brooklyn rules.” However, at least I knew that was the case before I started playing. Here the consumer is unable to reasonably determine what the rules are.
Fifth, the requirement that a customer give the agency 180 days to resolve a challenge to a billing is a reasonable one that can be provided in a contract; however, there is nothing in the contract to inform the customer what happens if the “chailenge” is not resolved favorably to the customer. Nor does the agreement notify the customer that a notice of claim may have to be filed prior to bringing a lawsuit and that the filing of a “challenge” might not qualify as a notice of claim or although timely as a challenge, might be too late to serve as a valid notice of claim. The contract must provide a uniform system of filing claims setting forth the procedure to be followed, applicable time frames and proper venue.
The inescapable conclusion is that the E-Z Pass contract on its face constitutes a deceptive practice. The Legislature must take steps to insure that a uniform contract and procedure is in place for all residents of New York who subscribe to the system. We may have four judicial departments with four different sets of rules in our “unified court system,” but having four agencies with four separate procedures when a customer believes he or she has contracted with one totally different entity is a deceptive practice that entitles the claimant to damages of $50 (General Business Law § 349 [h]). Consumers should not have to depend on the largess of the public authority to come in and defend these actions and hope that the agency will not raise any procedural objections to the litigation. Blanche DuBois may be able to rely on “the kindness of strangers,” consumers should not. The proper party and the rules to follow in order to file a claim must be disclosed in the contract.
New York City Civil Court Act § 213 gives the court the authority to reform contracts where the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000. Although the court could use that power to “reform” the agreement between the claimant and the defendant to eliminate the procedural nightmares pointed out above, that would not solve the problems that inherently exist in defendant’s standard form application and agreement. The “Agreement” currently used for all E-Z Pass customers must be changed. Since the “reformation” of the contract would effect all customers, the aggregate of the monies involved in reforming those agreements is clearly in excess of the court’s jurisdictional limit of $25,000 and would deprive this court of jurisdiction.
Conclusion:
Judgment for defendant on the claimant’s contention that the defendant has overcharged the claimant. Claimant has failed to prove his prima facie case. Claimant did not comply with the terms of the agreement in regard to filing a written challenge with the defendant. Nor did claimant file a notice of claim as required by the Public Authorities Law as a condition precedent to pursuing a tort claim.
Judgment for claimant in the amount of $50 for violation of General Business Law § 349. The contract between the defendant and the claimant as a consumer on its face amounts to a deceptive practice. Claimant is entitled to interest from the date of judgment, costs and disbursements.
A search of the United States Patent and Trademark Office lists E-Z Pass as a service mark filed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in February 1993 and abandoned in October 1996. There is an entity registered as E-Z Pass Corp. in March 2001 from Elmhurst, Queens, with the New York Department of State, but it does not appear to be the same entity involved with the electronic toll collection system. Another search lists the participants in the New York State electronic toll collection program as Vollmer Associates LLP-New York City; Mark IV Industries-Ontario, Canada; Arntech Systems Corporation, Texas; Lockheed Information Management Systems Corporation-New Jersey; and Transcor-New Jersey. The Department of State of New York lists Arntech Systems Corporation as a Delaware corporation with its principal executive office in Hummelstown, Pennsylvania. There is also an entity called Transcore Holdings, Inc. operating from the same Pennsylvania address as Arntech. Arntech is currently an active corporation in New York. Mark IV Industries Limited, a Canadian business, was dissolved by proclamation in September 1997 as was Transcor, Ltd. in September 1994. However, other corporations with similar names are currently active in New York State.
To further complicate this action, information in March 1998 lists a regional consortium of five toll authorities in the northeast as having contracted with MFS Network Technologies, Inc. to run the E-Z Pass system. MFS Network Technologies, Inc. was filed as a foreign corporation with the Secretary of State of New York on November 22, 1989 with its executive offices in Omaha, Nebraska. A current search lists that corporation as being “inactive.” This corporation may somehow be related to another Delaware corporation called Adesta Communications, Inc., whose principal office is also in Omaha, Nebraska.
Legislation enacted in 2001 by the New Hampshire State Legislature defines “E-Z Pass” as “a regional system of electronic toll collection operated by the members of the E-Z Pass Interagency Group, or when the context requires, means the registered service mark ‘E-Z Pass’.” (NH Rev Stat Ann § 237:16-a [IV].) “Interagency group” is defined as “the agencies of this or any other state that have mutually agreed to operate the E-Z Pass regional electronic toll collection system by use of similar practices, procedures, and toll collection equipment” (§ 237:16-a [V]). No similar statute exists in New York that expressly refers to the E-Z Pass system.
Interpretive letter No. 731, dated July 1, 1996, issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency pursuant to 12 USC § 24 (Seventh), refers to the public authorities who are members of the E-Z Pass Interagency Group as the “Consortium.”",0
0822-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Rolando T. Acosta, J.
Petitioner’s motion for an order dismissing respondent’s first affirmative defense (lack of personal jurisdiction) is granted inasmuch as respondent failed to move to dismiss within 60 days of service of the answer on that basis. (CPLR 3211 [e].)
Pursuant to CPLR 3211 (e) (as amended in 1996), a respondent who raises the defense of improper service of notice of petition and petition by way of answer has 60 days after serving the answer to move to dismiss on that basis unless the court extends the time upon the ground of undue hardship. (Aretakis v Tarantino, 300 AD2d 160 [1st Dept 2002]; Worldcom v Dialing Loving Care, 269 AD2d 159 [1st Dept 2000]; Zueco v Antin, 257 AD2d 421, 422 [1st Dept 1999].) The purpose of the amendment was “to require a party with a genuine objection to service to deal with the issue promptly and at the outset of the action. The provision w[ould] ferret out unjustified objections and w[ould] provide for prompt resolution of those that have merit.”
By its express terms, CPLR 3211 (e) does not apply to summary proceedings commenced pursuant to RPAPL 711 (1), (2) (holdover and nonpayment proceedings where a landlord-tenant relationship exists). Actions brought under RPAPL 713, however, are not listed as being excluded from the 60-day waiver provision. (See report from Counsel to the Honorable Jonathan Lippman, Chief Administrative Judge, to the Counsel to the Governor, July 18, 1996, Bill Jacket, L 1996, ch 501, which does not mention proceedings commenced pursuant to RPAPL 713 as an exception to the 60-day waiver provision [the 60-day provision “would not apply to a summary proceeding to evict a tenant under subdivision 1 or 2 of section 711 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law”].) Accordingly, the 60-day waiver provision applies to summary proceedings commenced pursuant to RPAPL 713.
This interpretation is consistent with the strict compliance standard for summary eviction proceedings. (Cf. MSG Pomp Corp. v Doe, 185 AD2d 798 [1st Dept 1992] [it is well!established that there must be strict compliance with statutory requirements in summary proceedings].) It should also be ¡noted that “holdover proceedings” to evict squatters or licensees are technically not holdover proceedings because there never was a landlord-tenant relationship. (Scherer, Residential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York § 8:1 [2003 rev ed].) That the Legislature chose to confer on a tenant more rights than on a licensee is not a matter before this court. |
Here, petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to RPAPL 713 (7), asserting that respondent’s license expired upon the death of the tenant. Respondent filed the verified amended answer and counterclaim on December 31, 2002, raising as its first affirmative defense that the notice of petition and petition were improperly served. Accordingly, respondentj had until March 3, 2003 to move to dismiss the petition for improper service, but failed to do so. Nor has respondent alleged any hardship excusing the filing deadline. Respondent’s first ¡affirmative defense is therefore waived.

Louis B. York, J.
In this personal injury action, defendants, New York University (NYU), Corporate Interiors Contracting, Inc. (Corp), Eastern Exterior Wall Systems and Exterior Erecting Services, Inc., collectively move for relief on several grounds. First, defendants move for summary judgment dismissing the complaint of plaintiffs, Walter Field (Field) and Kristen Field. Second, defendants seek an order dismissing Cranes, Inc.’s third-party complaint against Eastern and Exterior and dismissing all cross claims alleged by Cranes against all of the other defendants. Third, defendants ask that, in the alternative, the court grant summary judgment for NYU, Corp and Eastern against Cranes. The court will discuss each in turn.
NYU, owner of Kimble Hall, contracted with Corp to make renovations on the aforementioned property. Corp subcontracted with Eastern to fabricate exterior wall partitions for Kimble Hall. Eastern then subcontracted with Exterior to install the partitions at the site. Coplaintiff Field is an employee of Exterior.
On September 9, 2000, Exterior leased a crane and a crane operator from Cranes to lift exterior wall panels being affixed to the structure. The hoisting was completed that day. Then, the process of readying the crane to leave began. Field, wearing gloves, placed his hand on the left rear outrigger to brace himself while he maneuvered the release handle so he could remove its footing plate. This step was necessary for retraction of the outrigger by Mr. Cosban, the crane operator. While Field’s left hand was on the outrigger, Mr. Cosban retracted it and plaintiff’s fingers were crushed. Plaintiffs subsequently commenced a lawsuit against NYU, Corp and Cranes asserting claims of common-law negligence and violation of several provisions of the Labor Law. Defendants then demanded from plaintiffs a verified bill of particulars.
On May 3, 2001, plaintiffs served defendants a verified bill of particulars stating that Field suffered a “total amputation of the left index finger and severe laceration of the middle finger.” On June 2001, Cranes impleaded Exterior and Eastern, claiming contribution and indemnity based on common-law and contract terms.
I. Summary Judgment Dismissing Plaintiffs’ Complaint
Defendants NYU, Corp and Eastern move for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint. Defendants claim this prong of their motion should be granted because none of the parties supervised, directed, or controlled any of the work performed by Field and because, as a matter of law, there are no statutory violations under the circumstances of this case.
Defendants argue that there are no valid claims against them under Labor Law § 240 (1) or § 200 (1). However, plaintiffs have not asserted any Labor Law § 240 (1) claims. Additionally, plaintiffs have withdrawn any Labor Law § 200 (1) or common-law negligence claims except as against Cranes. Therefore, it is unnecessary to address these arguments.
Therefore, plaintiffs’ remaining claim is that defendants violated Labor Law § 241 (6). This section states that “[a]ll areas in which construction, excavation or demolition work is being performed shall be so constructed, shored, equipped, guarded, arranged, operated and conducted as to provide reasonable and adequate protection and safety to the persons employed therein or lawfully frequenting such places.” (Labor Law § 241 [6].) To assert a valid section 241 (6) claim, plaintiffs must allege a specific violation of the Industrial Code. (Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., 81 NY2d 494 [1993].)
Here, plaintiffs have satisfied the statutory standard by setting forth two such violations. First, plaintiffs claim that defendants violated 12 NYCRR 23-8.2 (b) (2) (iii). 12 NYCRR 23-8.2 (b) (2) (iii) states that “[e]ach outrigger on a mobile crane shall be visible from its actuating location.” Because the provision contains concrete specifications and not general safety standards, it is sufficient to satisfy Labor Law § 241 (6). (See Padilla v Schervier Hous. Dev. Fund Corp., 303 AD2d 194, 196 [1st Dept 2003].) However, plaintiffs cannot survive the motion for summary judgment on this claim. As defendants point out, plaintiffs have not produced evidentiary material showing that this section of the Industrial Code was violated. Field testified that it was possible for Mr. Cosban to view the outrigger from where he sat to operate the crane. Mr. Cosban testified that he checked the outrigger before retracting it. It is clear from the depositions of Field and Mr. Cosban, annexed in both plaintiffs’ and defendants’ affidavits, that the outrigger was in fact visible from its actuating location. (See Zuckerman v City of New York, 49 NY2d 557, 563 [1980] [attorney affirmation may “serve as the vehicle for the submission of acceptable attachments which do provide ‘evidentiary proof in admissible form’ ”].) Thus, plaintiffs’ own affidavits and evidence support defendants’ argument that there was compliance with this rule.
Second, plaintiffs claim that defendants violated 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (i). This provision states in relevant part that “[e]xposed moving components or parts of mobile cranes . . . such as . . . reciprocating parts . . . shall be guarded and such guards shall be securely fastened in place.” Plaintiffs argue that this section of the Industrial Code is specific and may therefore support a valid Labor Law § 241 (6) claim.
The court has found no reported cases on the issue, so it is for this court to determine as a matter of law whether 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (i) qualifies as a general or specific provision of the Industrial Code. (See Messina v City of New York, 300 AD2d 121, 123 [1st Dept 2002].) In determining how to classify this particular Industrial Code provision, the court will perform an analysis according to the guidelines set forth in Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co. (81 NY2d 494 [1993]). Under Ross (at 502), “allegations . . . which rely on claimed failures to measure up to such general regulatory criteria as ‘adequate,’ ‘effective’ and ‘proper,’ are not sufficient to give rise to a triable claim for damages under Labor Law § 241 (6).”
The court in Howell v Koch Erecting Corp. followed the same criteria in deciding that 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (b) (1), regarding the monthly inspection of cranes at work sites, is a specific provision of the Industrial Code. (Howell v Koch Erecting Corp., 192 Misc 2d 491 [Sup Ct, Bronx County 2002].) There, the court made its determination based on the facts that (1) the provision contributes to overall safety of the work site, (2) it would prevent numerous crane injuries and (3) it cites the parts that must be inspected. Unlike that provision, the one at issue here— Industrial Code provision 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (i) — does not cite the specific exposed moving reciprocating parts that must be guarded on a mobile crane. Moreover, this provision is also distinguishable because adherence to it would not necessarily prevent numerous crane injuries.
Rather, 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (a), the provision of the Industrial Code now in question, is comparable to 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (i). The Court in Goss v State Univ. Constr. Fund held that 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (a) is a general provision because it merely states a general safety requirement concerning crane stability. (Goss v State Univ. Constr. Fund, 261 AD2d 860, 861 [4th Dept 1999], lv dismissed in part and denied in part 94 NY2d 847 [1999].) Similarly, 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (i) sets forth a general requirement regarding the exposed moving parts on a mobile crane. Therefore, 12 NYCRR 23-8.1 (i) is a general provision of the Industrial Code and cannot support a claim under Labor Law § 241 (6).
In sum, plaintiffs have failed to set forth a legitimate Labor Law § 241 (6) claim. The court will therefore grant the prong of the motion of NYU, Corp and Eastern that seeks summary judgment.
II. Dismissal of Cranes’ Complaint against Eastern and Exterior
In their motion, third-party defendants Eastern and Exterior contend that the claims made against them by the third-party defendant, Cranes, should be dismissed. They argue that dismissal is appropriate because Exterior is precluded due to Workers’ Compensation Law § 11. In response, Cranes cross-moves to amend its third-party claim to include an allegation that plaintiff sustained a “grave injury” as defined by section 11 of the Workers’ Compensation Law.
Courts will freely grant parties leave to amend their pleadings absent prejudice or surprise. (CPLR 3025 [b]; McCaskey, Davies & Assoc. v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp., 59 NY2d 755 [1983].) The court will deny leave where the proposed amended pleading is devoid of merit. (Ancrum v St. Barnabas Hosp., 301 AD2d 474, 475 [1st Dept 2003].)
According to third-party defendants, Cranes’ claim that Field sustained a grave injury is without merit. However, under section 11 of the Workers’ Compensation Law, loss of an index finger is considered a grave injury. Third-party defendants rely on the medical reports, which indicate that the retraction of the outrigger only caused a partial amputation of Field’s left index finger. A partial amputation, although serious, would not be grave within the meaning of the law. (See McCoy v Queens Hydraulic Co., 286 AD2d 425, 426 [2d Dept 2001].) Yet, the rest of the finger was amputated shortly after. Thus, Field did in fact suffer loss of an index finger. Under these circumstances, an amendment to third-party plaintiffs pleading is not so implausible that the court should not grant Cranes’ cross motion. The accuracy of Cranes’ allegation is a question of fact to be decided by the factfinder.
Therefore, the court grants Cranes’ cross motion to amend its third-party complaint. As a result, third-party defendants’ motion to dismiss the original version of Cranes’ complaint is no longer applicable. Accordingly, the court denies third-party defendants’ motion to dismiss.
III. Summary Judgment for NYU, Corp and Eastern from Cranes
Without conceding any liability for Field’s injuries, NYU, Corp and Eastern move for summary judgment on their common-law and contractual indemnification claims against Cranes. Yet, defendants do not offer any evidentiary support or point to case law upon which to base their claim. Moreover, the claim that there was no direct supervision by movants is made by counsel, who has no personal knowledge. There are numerous pleadings collectively annexed to the motion as “exhibit A,” rather than individually tabbed as required by Rules of the Justices of Supreme Court, Civil Branch, New York County, rule 14 (b). Moreover, some of the annexed pages are upside down. Both of these make the exhibit harder to follow. Nonetheless, the court has examined the exhibit and the other annexed documents. Though the answers are called “verified” answers, the court cannot locate these verifications. Thus, the allegations in the answers regarding control and indemnification have no evidentiary value. The court also cannot locate a copy of the contracts’ indemnification clauses. Finally on this issue, in defendants’ reply papers, defendants only mention that Cranes has failed to assert any opposition on this issue. However, as explained, defendants’ argument is conclusory and insufficient; and, as they have not carried their burden, their adversary had no obligation to counter the argument. The court will therefore deny this prong of defendants’ motion without prejudice to having it renewed at a later time with proper evidentiary support and with a better explanation of the basis of their argument.
Based on the above, therefore, it is ordered that the portion of the motion seeking summary judgment dismissing Field’s complaint against NYU, Corp and Eastern is granted and the complaint as against NYU, Corp and Eastern is severed and dismissed; and it is further ordered that the portion of the motion seeking summary judgment dismissing the cross claims asserted against NYU, Corp and Eastern in Cranes’ answer is denied; and it is further ordered that the motion to dismiss Cranes’ complaint against Eastern and Exterior and to dismiss all cross claims alleged by Cranes against all of the other defendants is denied; and it is further ordered that the cross motion to permit Cranes leave to amend its complaint in the form attached to the motion papers is granted.",0

Memorandum.
Judgment of conviction unanimously modified upon the law by reversing the conviction of assault in the third degree and, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by dismissing said count of the accusatory instrument; as so modified, affirmed.
The prosecutor’s information, which was read into the record, was legally sufficient to support the charges of sexual abuse in the second degree and sexual abuse in the third degree (see Penal Law §§ 130.55, 130.60 [2]).°We note that the very definition of “sexual contact” includes the requirement that it be done for the purpose of sexual gratification (see Penal Law § 130.00 [3]). Moreover, sexual gratification is a subjective determination which may be inferred from the nature of the acts committed and the circumstances under which they occurred (see Matter of Kryzstof K., 283 AD2d 431, 432 [2001]; People v Beecher, 225 AD2d 943, 944 [1996]; People v Victor P., 120 Misc 2d 770 [1983]). Accordingly it was unnecessary to set forth the element of sexual gratification in the accusatory instrument.
With the exception of the count of assault in the third degree, the defendant’s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence is unpreserved. A claim is not preserved for appellate review when a defendant asserts different grounds at trial from those asserted on appeal (see People v Monroe, 90 NY2d 982 [1997]; People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 19 [1995]). Moreover, a claim of legal insufficiency is not preserved by a motion to vacate pursuant to CPL 330.30 (see People v Hines, 97 NY2d 56 [2001]; People v Jones, 188 AD2d 331 [1992]). In any event, the claims are without merit.
With respect to the count of assault in the third degree, this court finds that the evidence adduced at trial was legally insufficient to establish the “physical injury” element of the charge, since there was insufficient evidence to establish an “impairment of physical condition or substantial pain” (Penal Law § 10.00 [9]). Accordingly, the conviction on that count is reversed (CPL 470.15 [2]). Inasmuch as the defendant has already completed serving his sentence, and remittitur for resentence on that count would serve no useful penological purpose, the count of assault in the third degree is dismissed (see People v Burwell, 53 NY2d 849 [1981]).
Upon review of the record, we are satisfied that the verdicts with respect to all the remaining counts of the accusatory instrument were not against the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.15 [5]).
We are of the opinion that the trial court properly sustained objections to questions proposed to the prosecution witness, Maria Martinovic, on the ground that such questions were improper or would have elicited inadmissible hearsay. Moreover, any testimony by the two police officers whose testimony was sought to be introduced by defendant was properly precluded as collateral and not relevant to the issues in this case, where the officers were not involved in the incident, and where their testimony would have invited speculation on the part of the jurors.
Finally, the court’s failure to read the statutory definition of “sexual contact” in its instruction to the jury on the sexual abuse charges was not reversible error (cf. People v Blacknall, 63 NY2d 912 [1984]) in that there has been no showing that the jury could have been misled as a result of the omission. In any event, any error in failing to charge the definition was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With respect to the challenge to the court’s instruction to the jury on the charge of criminal trespass in the second degree, that issue is not preserved for appellate review and, in any event, is without merit.

After the kinship issues had been determined in this proceeding to judicially settle the account of the public administrator, supplemental process was served upon all of the heirs of the decedent’s postdeceased brother and sole distributee, which directed them, inter alia, to show cause why the court should not fix the fee of counsel who had represented two objectants (who together receive one third of the net distributable estate) in the amount requested and direct that the balance due for these legal services in the sum of $9,495, plus disbursements, be paid by the estate. No objections have been filed.
As a general rule counsel may only be compensated by clients who retain them (Matter of A.G. Ship Maintenance Corp. v Lezak, 69 NY2d 1 [1986]; Mighty Midgets v Centennial Ins. Co., 47 NY2d 12 [1979]; City of Buffalo v Clement Co., 28 NY2d 241 [1971]). However, where, as here, counsel has in effect benefit-ted the entire estate by providing legal services establishing the identity of the decedent’s distributees, counsel may be compensated from estate assets even though counsel was not retained by the fiduciary of the estate or by all of the distributees (Matter of Wiltshire, 4 AD2d 981 [1957]; Matter of Reedy, 49 Misc 2d 81 [1966]). This is equitable in this case because otherwise the distributees receiving two thirds of the estate would be unjustly enriched by receiving free legal services establishing their entitlement to distributive shares at the expense of the distributees receiving only one third of the estate. However, counsel’s affidavit of services reflects that some of the services provided were not related to establishing kinship but, instead, essentially consisted of monitoring the duties of the fiduciary with regard to tax returns and other matters. The distributees who did not retain counsel should not be required to pay for these volunteer services because they are already paying for the legal services of the fiduciary’s counsel. Moreover, to the extent that compensation is to be paid from the interests of parties who did not retain counsel, such compensation must be fixed on a quantum meruit basis rather than pursuant to the terms of any retainer agreement that counsel might have entered into with the two object-ants or based solely upon counsel’s usual hourly charge. Based upon the reasonable value of counsel’s efforts in establishing kinship, the court fixes the balance of the compensation to be paid to counsel from the estate in the sum of $7,000, plus disbursements of $79.",0
0239-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Diane A. Lebedeff, J.
This motion presents a question of significance in many guardianship proceedings commenced under article 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law (article 81), to wit: If a person believes he or she was defamed in an out-of-court statement made to a court evaluator in the context of a guardianship proceeding commenced under article 81, will a defamation action lie or, alternatively, will the defamation claim be defeated by the longstanding common-law rule that a statement made in the course of judicial proceedings is absolutely privileged so long as pertinent to the controversy? This issue is directly posed by defendant’s motion to dismiss this defamation action based upon the defendant’s remarks to a court evaluator during the evaluator’s investigation (CPLR 3211 [a] [7]).
To the extent relevant, in 1999, a guardianship proceeding was commenced and a court evaluator appointed to investigate the article 81 petition seeking appointment of a guardian for an alleged incapacitated person (AIP). During the course of the court evaluator’s investigation, the defendant, then 74 years old and a tenant of the same building in which the AIP resided, telephoned the court evaluator. The complaint alleges defendant stated his view that the landlord was engaged in a “terrorist conspiracy” to harass elderly tenants into vacating their apartments, and secretly entered into such tenants’ apartments through their windows. The court evaluator characterized these remarks as a “soap opera script,” “questioned] their basis in reality,” and viewed them as instigated by another party who also made “accusations of the murderous intentions of the landlord.” The proceeding concluded with the appointment of a guardian.
The defendant advances a claim of absolute privilege, which has been characterized as “a veritable immunity” in relation to the publication of a given defamatory statement claim (Stukuls v State of New York, 42 NY2d 272, 275 [1977]). Where the facts are undisputed, as in this case, it is a pure question of law whether an absolute privilege applies and stands as a complete defense to a defamation claim (People ex rel. Bensky v Warden of City Prison, 258 NY 55, 60 [1932]). Because of the novelty of the issue raised, reaching an answer requires consideration of the following interrelated factors: (1) whether the speaker’s remarks were of a character permitting the assertion of the privilege; (2) whether addressing such remarks to a court evaluator is a statement made in the course of a judicial proceeding; and (3) whether the speaker has standing to claim the privilege.
I
The first issue is whether the nature of the alleged defamatory statement is one for which an absolute privilege may be claimed. Defendant seeks the protection of the general rule that statements made by parties, attorneys and witnesses in the course of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding are absolutely privileged, notwithstanding the motive with which they are made, so long as they are material and pertinent to the issues to be resolved in the proceeding (Mosesson v Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Firm, 257 AD2d 381 [1st Dept 1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 808 [1999]; see also, Herzfeld & Stern v Beck, 175 AD2d 689, 691 [1st Dept 1991], appeal dismissed 79 NY2d 914 [1992], 89 NY2d 1064 [1997]; Wiener v Weintraub, 22 NY2d 330, 331-332 [1968]; Allan & Allan Arts v Rosenblum, 201 AD2d 136, 139 [2d Dept 1994], lv denied 85 NY2d 921 [1995], cert denied 516 US 914 [1995]).
The well-settled test for a statement to which absolute privilege extends is that it is “possibly pertinent” to the litigation which means it “may possibly bear on the issues in litigation now or at some future time” even if only by “the barest rationality, divorced from any palpable or pragmatic degree of probability” (Seltzer v Fields, 20 AD2d 60, 62 [1st Dept 1963], affd 14 NY2d 624 [1964]). When considering “whether the alleged defamatory statements are pertinent to the judicial proceeding, [the statements] should be liberally construed,” with all doubts “resolved in favor of its relevancy or pertinency” (Baratta v Hubbard, 136 AD2d 467, 469 [1st Dept 1988] [internal quotation marks omitted]).
These quoted formulations of the governing concepts are fully consistent with, but give more guidance than, the older characterization that an absolute privilege does not extend to “language used [which] goes beyond the bounds of reason and is so clearly impertinent and needlessly defamatory as not to admit of discussion” (People ex rel. Bensky v Warden of City Prison, supra, 258 NY at 59). It is noted that the pertinency standard is entirely different from the test for striking scandalous matter from a pleading (Kahane v Murdoch, 218 App Div 591, 593-594 [1st Dept 1926]).
A most useful test “[t]o appreciate . . . pertinency, [is to] ask . . . what the duty of [the participants] would have been, had [the statement] been true” (Andrews v Gardiner, 224 NY 440, 446 [1918]). This question gives ready guidance as to whether “the statement [is] so outrageously out of [the litigation] context as to permit one to conclude, from the mere fact that the statement was uttered, that it was motivated by no other desire than to defame” (Martirano v Frost, 25 NY2d 505, 508 [1969]).
Here, had defendant’s alleged statement been true and if the landlord of the alleged incapacitated person were harassing elderly tenants and breaking into their apartments, such information would have been highly relevant to the guardianship proceeding. A mandated consideration in such proceedings is housing conditions and, if a guardian is to be appointed, whether an alleged incapacitated person may be maintained in his or her current housing in the community (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.22 [a] [9] [requires, in relevant part: “the choice of abode must be consistent with . . . the care, comfort and maintenance, and where appropriate, rehabilitation of the incapacitated person”]; see also, Matter of Gambuti [Bowser], 242 AD2d 431, 434 [1st Dept 1997] [housing in community must remain an active consideration even if ward placed in nursing home]; Matter of Linden-Rath, 188 Misc 2d 537, 542 [Sup Ct, NY County 2001] [obligation of article 81 guardian to preserve ward’s housing]).
Accordingly, the remarks were entirely relevant to the guardianship proceeding and, as a matter of law, pertinent to the proceedings.
II
The second issue is whether addressing such an out-of-court statement to a court evaluator is a statement made in the course of a judicial proceeding (Seltzer v Fields, supra, 20 AD2d at 63 [“A corollary of the pertinency rule is that the absolute privilege is afforded only to those publications made ‘during the course of or, stated differently, ‘as part of, the judicial proceeding” for “communications unconnected with the judicial proceeding are not cloaked with the absolute privilege”]). Given that the extension of the absolute privilege to a statement made to a court evaluator is a matter of first impression, the extension of this privilege must be considered with due care for “New York has been reluctant to extend the applicability of absolute privilege to cases that would represent a departure from the policies which originally brought the doctrine into being” (Stukuls v State of New York, supra, 42 NY2d at 277).
This analysis considers not the speaker, but the audience. In relation to an article 81 proceeding, a court evaluator is neither a party nor counsel to a party. Generally, only counsel, parties, witnesses and the court itself are held to be covered by the rule and the few scattered cases extending the absolute privilege to an appointee have not examined the reasons for such result (Sorge v City of New York, 56 Misc 2d 414 [Sup Ct, NY County 1968, Samuel A. Spiegel, J.] [under letters rogatory, Italian magistrate took testimony, such proceeding found to be judicial]; Abrams v Crompton-Richmond Co., 7 Misc 2d 461, 462 [Sup Ct, NY County 1957], affd 5 AD2d 811 [1st Dept 1958], lv denied 4 NY2d 676 [1958] [“The plaintiffs’ brief points out that a bankruptcy referee is not a judicial officer. We do not pass upon this question, as the only requirement is that the proceedings be judicial”]; see also, Friedman v Alexander, 79 AD2d 627, 628 [2d Dept 1980] [letters to creditors from company official approved by Bankruptcy Court “were written and sent in the course of a judicial proceeding”]).
The court here begins with a review of the position of a court evaluator in an article 81 judicial proceeding, a position filled by appointment by the judge presiding over the case. The court evaluator must perform statutorily defined investigative and reporting tasks (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09), and, in addition, a court evaluator must attend all court proceedings and conferences and be available as a witness at the hearing itself (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [c] [9]; § 81.12 [b]). In the simplest of terms, the court evaluator serves as “the eyes and ears of the court” in performing an investigation. The court finds that numerous reasons, both of public policy and procedure, support extending the absolute privilege to an utterance or writing directed at a court evaluator.
The primary policy factor weighed when extending the absolute privilege is the societal interest which “requires that whenever [persons] seek the aid of the courts of justice ... to assert or to defend rights of person, property, [or] liberty, speech and writing therein must be untrammelled and free. The good of all must prevail over the incidental harm to the individual. So the law offers a shield to the one who in legal proceedings publishes a libel, not because it wishes to encourage libel, but because if [persons] were afraid to set forth their rights in legal proceedings for fear of liability to libel suits, greater harm would result, in the suppression of the truth” (1 Seelman, The Law of Libel and Slander in the State of New York, at 233, para 191 [1964], quoted in Allan & Allan Arts v Rosenblum, supra, 201 AD2d at 139). This interest is directly implicated here for virtually no other civil proceeding more directly and simultaneously challenges personal, property and liberty interests than a guardianship proceeding (see, Matter of St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr. [.Marie H.], NYLJ, Dec. 8, 1992, at 22, col 2 [Sup Ct, NY County, Glen, J.] [recognizing liberty interest requires assignment of counsel to the indigent in an article 81 proceeding], mod and remanded 215 AD2d 337 [1st Dept 1995], affd 226 AD2d 106 [1st Dept 1996], affd 89 NY2d 889 [1996]).
A corollary consideration is that free communication in relation to a court proceeding should not be chilled by the threat of defamation litigation. The purpose of the absolute privilege is to eliminate the fear that a person speaks or reports “at. . . peril, if it later be determined that some statement . . . involved, [which fear] ‘would be an impediment to justice, because it would hamper the search for truth and prevent making inquiries with that freedom and boldness which the welfare of society requires’ ” (Martirano v Frost, supra, 25 NY2d at 508-509, quoting Youmans v Smith, 153 NY 214, 220 [1897]). It takes no great astuteness to understand that the freedom to collect defamatory but pertinent information is necessary if a court evaluator is to perform a full investigation and report the evaluator’s informed conclusions to the court. To take just one common example — an allegation of financial abuse of an elderly person — a court evaluator must often conduct interviews and review records to determine if such abuse exists or if a valid reason indicates the behavior is innocent (see Matter of Kustka, 163 Misc 2d 694, 697 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1994, Kassoff, J.] [widowed 81-year-old man weds former housekeeper, court evaluator reports new wife dissipates funds and sends money to relatives outside the country]). The threat that a court evaluator might become the target of a defamation action, or even be drawn into a defamation action as a nonparty witness, would clearly have a detrimental effect on the diligent collection and reporting of relevant information.
An additional factor often considered by courts is whether the statement is made during the course of a proceeding at which the statement might possibly be identified and challenged. The Court of Appeals has expressed concern that the privilege not be extended to occasions where “the absence of a hearing” permits a derogatory statement to “go unheard of, let alone challenged,” which provides “an unchecked vehicle for silent but effective character assassination” (Toker v Pollak, 44 NY2d 211, 222 [1978] [additionally holding a report to a district attorney does not warrant the absolute privilege because it is a statement to an official whose “function is more analogous to that of the police officer than that of the Judge” (44 NY2d at 220), and that “absolute immunity ‘applies only to a proceeding in court or one before an officer having attributes similar to a court’ ” (44 NY2d at 219), quoting Pecue v West, 233 NY 316, 321 (1922)]). Here, as amply demonstrated by this record, the court evaluator both included and refuted the remark in the resulting report and, if pivotal to the proceeding, the statement was capable of exploration at the article 81 hearing.
Turning to procedural considerations, it cannot be overstated that the existence of a complete and detailed report by the court evaluator is critically important to the exercise of the judicial function, not only for the article 8l hearing process but also as a reference point for future consideration. The court evaluator’s report is utilized at the hearing and upon judicial review of the outcome (see Matter of Khoubesserian, 264 AD2d 599, 601 [1st Dept 1999] [reference to report’s detailed recitation of financial management and court evaluator’s assessment of such management as “careful,” “quite thorough” and “accurate,” with “no discrepancies”]; compare Matter of Chase, 264 AD2d 330, 333 [1st Dept 1999] [“While initial examination of . . . transfers [identified by the court evaluator] could lead one to suspect improprieties, careful scrutiny reveals that the transfers were not nefarious”]). Even years later in the guardianship proceeding, the report gives a point of comparison for a change of conditions (see Matter of Linden-Rath, supra, 188 Misc 2d at 544 [comparing current condition of ward’s apartment with description in earlier evaluator’s report]). And when a ward dies, the Surrogate’s Court may find such report sheds significant light on past transactions (see Matter of Rose BB., 262 AD2d 805, 807 [3d Dept 1999] [dispute regarding identification and ownership of assets transferred to Surrogate’s Court upon ward’s death, given that “death of an incapacitated person does not require a guardian’s immediate discharge (see Mental Hygiene Law § 81.36 [a] [3]; Matter of Siracusano, 167 Misc 2d 130) particularly where, as here, there is a dispute regarding the preservation of the incapacitated person’s property pending”]). Accordingly, the interests of the proper administration of justice is an additional policy factor which weighs in favor of granting the absolute privilege in this context.
Finally, some recognition must be given to the fact that an article 81 guardianship proceeding has a unique and sui generis character, setting it apart from other litigation. Article 81 guardianship proceedings frequently raise serious challenges to the judgment, morality and legal propriety of actions of a variety of persons involved with an alleged incapacitated person, not all of whom are parties to the litigation. In a vast majority of such cases, some person interviewed by a court evaluator will have a highly charged view of a person or entity involved with the alleged incapacitated person, which views may prove to be inaccurate or unrealistic. Yet, these are matters which must be investigated and addressed by a court evaluator without hindrance or reservation, for even the wildest accusations may hold a germ of truth which leads to a development of facts germane to an accurate assessment. Given the legislative design of the scope and processes of an article 81 guardianship proceeding, the court is satisfied that extending recognition of the absolute privilege to remarks made to a court evaluator is vital to the judicial quest for soundly based determinations on the paramount issues presented in a guardianship proceeding, i.e., whether an innocent person suffers from an incapacity and, for such reason, should be stripped of all or some degree of liberty and control of person and property.
Accordingly, where a statement is pertinent to the litigation, given that the court evaluator serves as an investigative agent of the court and acts on behalf of the court and that no public policy mandates to the contrary, this court holds that a statement made to a court evaluator is a communication properly subject to the absolute privilege.
III
The final issue is whether the defendant has standing to claim the protection of this rule. Once pertinent speech in court or to a recognized participant in an ongoing judicial proceeding is established, virtually every speaker whose speech is connected with the litigation has standing to assert this immunity from suit (Herzfeld & Stern v Beck, 175 AD2d 689 [1st Dept 1991], appeal dismissed 79 NY2d 914 [1992], lv dismissed 82 NY2d 789 [1993]). “[T]he . . . privilege attaches ... to every step of the proceeding in question even if it is preliminary and/or investigatory” (175 AD2d at 691) and is extended “to all who take part in judicial proceedings, judge, attorney, counsel, printer, witness, litigant, a right to speak and to write, subject only to one limitation, that what is said or written bears upon the subject of litigation” (1 Seelman, The Law of Libel and Slander in the State of New York, supra, quoted in Allan & Allan Arts v Rosenblum, supra, 201 AD2d at 139; see Youmans v Smith, supra, 153 NY at 222 [printer who prepared duplicate copies of questions drafted for use at a hearing, including questions to which the plaintiff took umbrage, protected by absolute privilege, albeit as agent of attorney]).
The fact that the alleged defamation involved an out-of-court communication does not bar application of the absolute privilege (see, Simon v Stim, 11 Misc 2d 653 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1958] [applying privilege to letters written after the commencement of litigation], affd 10 AD2d 647 [2d Dept 1960]; Simon v Potts, 33 Misc 2d 183 [Sup Ct, Rensselaer County 1962]; Zirn v Cullom, 187 Misc 241 [Sup Ct, NY County 1946]; compare State-Wide Ins. Co. v Glavin, 18 AD2d 629 [1st Dept 1962] [finding letter not pertinent]; Lapetina v Santangelo, 124 App Div 519 [2d Dept 1908] [prelitigation letter not protected by absolute privilege]). Further, it matters not that the defendant reached out to volunteer his statement (Wiener v Weintraub, 22 NY2d 330 [1968] [letter of complaint to attorney disciplinary body protected by absolute privilege for witnesses]).
Defendant most readily falls into the classification of a potential witness. As stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 588 (1977), “[a] witness is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory matter concerning another in communications . . . as a part of a judicial proceeding . . . if it has some relation to the proceeding.” The official commentary states that such privilege extends to statements made in “private conferences” and not under oath (Comment 6), which appears generally consistent with New York law (Panzella v Burns, 169 AD2d 824 [2d Dept 1991] [pertinent statement made in judge’s chambers absolutely privileged]).
Accordingly, the defendant is determined to have standing to assert his claim for recognition of the absolute privilege in relation to his statements made to a court evaluator in the course of the investigatory phase of an article 81 proceeding.
Given the foregoing, it is not necessary to determine whether the defamatory remarks are pleaded with sufficient particularity (CPLR 3106 [a]).
Accordingly, the motion is granted and the complaint is dismissed.
. The court evaluator appointed was the able Eleanor Cappagrosso, Esq. Her investigation uncovered the circumstances underlying the third party’s designation in a new will and power of attorney, both of which were declared null and void because the documents were signed after the AIP became incapacitated (see Matter of Mary J., 290 AD2d 847, 850 [3d Dept 2002] [“court properly revoked the durable power of attorney and health care proxy since they were executed by respondent during a time that she was suffering from extreme dementia (see Mental Hygiene Law § 81.21 [d])”]; compare, Matter of Kern, 165 Misc 2d 108 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County 1995, Luciano, J.] [nondurable power of attorney expires by its own terms upon incapacity, consistent with General Obligations Law §§ 5-1601 and 5-1602]; see also, Matter of Wingate, 169 Misc 2d 701 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1996, Kassoff, J.] [power of attorney may be revoked by court upon finding breach of fiduciary duty]).
It is a fair reading of the evaluator’s report that the attack on the landlord may have been retaliation for the plaintiff landlord’s early suspicions about the AIP’s home care worker, who had introduced the AIP to the third party. The landlord requested an investigation by New York City Office of Protective Services for Adults and seems to have acted in a responsible manner with commendable care for his tenant.
. The court evaluator is not a formal party to an article 81 proceeding (Matter of Lula XX., 88 NY2d 842 [1996] [denying motion for leave to appeal by court evaluator because court evaluator was not a party]; cf. Matter of Chachkers [Shirley W], 159 Misc 2d 912 [Sup Ct, NY County 1993] [describing court evaluator as a party]). Nonetheless, a court evaluator can interpose motions at the trial court level (see, for example, Matter of Lichtenstein, 171 Misc 2d 29 [Sup Ct, Bronx County 1996] [motion to disqualify petitioner’s attorney by reason of attorney’s former representation of the AIP]) and can be empowered to take affirmative protective action during the pendency of a proceeding (Matter of Wingate [Longobardi], 166 Misc 2d 986 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County 1996, Luciano, J.] [payment for necessaries authorized]).
Nor is the court evaluator counsel to the AIP, which is a separate statutory role (compare Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09, with Mental Hygiene Law § 81.10; see also, Matter of Lee I., 265 AD2d 750, 752 [3d Dept 1999] [“the court evaluator’s role is not equivalent to that of counsel for the person alleged to be incapacitated”]).
. The court evaluator’s functions were summarized in Matter of Lichtenstein (223 AD2d 309, 313-314 [1st Dept 1996]) as follows: “The evaluator’s role under article 81 is that of an independent investigator, empowered to assist the court in independently assessing the totality of circumstances affecting the person alleged to be incapacitated (AIP), determining the AIP’s personal capabilities, marshalling the AIP’s resources, selecting and empowering an appropriate guardian, and assuring that the due process rights of the AIP are not violated. The evaluator’s duties include, inter alia, meeting with the AIP (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [c] [1]), explaining the nature and possible consequences of the proceeding and the AIP’s right to counsel (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [c] [2]), determining whether legal counsel should be appointed for the AIP (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [c] [3]), interviewing the petitioner (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [c] [4]), and issuing a written report and recommendations to address a lengthy list of specific questions and issues set out in the statute (Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [c] [5]).”
In a statutorily required report, the evaluator must “provide the court with his or her ‘personal observations as to the person alleged to be incapacitated and his or her condition, affairs and situation’ ” and “the report of the court evaluator should be, not ‘a rubber stamp’ of how others view the person, but rather a meaningful independent exploration of all aspects of the life of the allegedly incapacitated person” (18 Carmody-Wait 2d § 109:35 [Duties of Court Evaluator], quoting Law Revision Commn Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 34A, Mental Hygiene Law § 81.09 [1996 ed]).
. Similar reasoning has led courts to conclude that a law guardian of a young child in a custody dispute is immune from a legal malpractice claim where the law guardian’s function is primarily to aid the court, rather than to advocate for the child (Bluntt v O’Connor, 291 AD2d 106, 119 [4th Dept 2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 605 [2002] [noting, “Exposure of attorneys to tort liability to those they have been appointed to represent” would reduce the willingness to serve and such “disincentive is against public policy and should be eliminated”]; see also, Marquez v Presbyterian Hosp. in City of N.Y., 159 Misc 2d 617, 625 [Sup Ct, Bronx County 1994] [“People who exercise discretion and make value judgments in the ‘best interests’ of their ward must be protected from needless collateral litigation which would undermine their good-faith efforts”]). Such law guardians have also been found immune from other claims brought by parents (Bradt v White, 190 Misc 2d 526 [Sup Ct, Greene County 2002] [collecting cases]).
. It is assumed that the affected person or entity would not be excluded from the courtroom when testimony bore upon such person or entity (see Matter of Barrios-Paoli, 173 Misc 2d 1032, 1034 [Sup Ct, NY County 1997, Braun, J.], affd 268 AD2d 302 [1st Dept 2000] [appointment of guardian], appeal dismissed 94 NY2d 943 [2000] [landlords may be excluded from parts of an article 81 hearing when privileged or confidential information is advanced]).",0
0499-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
David Elliot, J.
This matter appeared on the part 15 trial calendar and was assigned to this part for trial. The attorneys indicated to the court that they wished to proceed by submission pursuant to a written stipulation. Though the action was not commenced as an action on submitted facts, it appeared that the parties wished to proceed at this juncture in the manner provided for in CPLR 3222.
The parties stipulated, among other facts, to the date of the automobile accident, the existence of no-fault coverage by the defendant, the receipt by the defendant of the claim for no-fault benefits and the defendant’s denial of claim form. While the parties stipulated that the controversy at issue was whether the procedures performed by the plaintiff were medically necessary, the affidavits in support of the positions of the respective parties indicated opposite positions as to that issue. One such opposing position is whether the assignor had any prior significant psychiatric history. While the defendant asserts that the claimant has a history of alcohol abuse, the claimant’s physician claims that she had no prior significant psychiatric or drug history. The determination to be made by the court is not one of law based upon agreed upon facts, but a determination based on the facts as differently presented by the parties. When proceeding by submission, all facts necessary to a complete determination of controversy must be unequivocally stipulated. (Satterfield v Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co., 272 App Div 127 [4th Dept 1947].)
This case is therefore not one to be presented by submission. The trier of the facts, in this case the judge, should not be limited in its evaluation of the testimony. The trier of the facts should have the opportunity to assess the demeanor of the witnesses on the stand, and to ask questions of the witnesses concerning their testimony about complex medical issues. The demeanor of witnesses may be of enormous importance where the trier of fact must decide which witnesses to believe, what portion of their testimony is to be accepted and what weight is to be ascribed thereto. (Matter of McMahan & Co. [Dunn Newfund I], 230 AD2d 1 [1st Dept 1997].)
Had the parties availed themselves of the arbitration process provided for in the Insurance Department regulations, they no doubt could have proceeded by submission, thereby avoiding the expense of producing medical experts at trial. Having chosen to have their dispute determined by the court, the parties cannot expect to take advantage of the simplified process available in arbitration. Accordingly, the matter is set down for trial on December 17, 2003 and marked final against both sides.",0
0697-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Zelda Jonas, J.
The petitioners had moved by order to show cause for a court order permitting petitioners to serve and file a notice of claim using pseudonyms to conceal the identity of the infant petitioners who are alleged victims of sex crimes. At this juncture, the actions have not been commenced since pleadings were not filed and served, and issue has not been joined. On the return date of the applications, the parties named in the captions of the notice of claims stipulated that petitioners are permitted to serve and file a notice of claim in the names of “John Doe 1,” “John Doe 2,” and “John Doe 3” as pseudonyms to protect the identity of the infant petitioners in the aboverentitled actions.
The respondent, Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District, cross-moved to seal the entire court record in the impending actions, and Newsday, Inc. has moved to intervene in opposition to respondent’s motion for a sealing order.
The petitioners have submitted papers opposing the sealing of the entire court record in the interest of the public. As an alternative, counsel for “John Doe 1 and 2” requests in his opposition papers that “the court order that all documents filed with this court be redacted to the extent necessary to preserve the identity of the infant claimants and their families.”
There is an overwhelming presumption that the public has the right of access to the courts to ensure the actual and perceived fairness of the judicial system. (See, Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct. of Cal., 464 US 501, 508 [1984].) The sealing of court records acts as a prior restraint on the First Amendment rights of the media to report, and “[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity” (New York Times Co. v United States, 403 US 713, 714 [1971]). The First Amendment was part of a series of amendments to the United States Constitution offered by one of our founding fathers, James Madison, to satisfy the citizens that these great liberties of freedom of the press, assembly, and speech would be safe and beyond the powers of government to abridge (New York Times Co. v United States at 716). “Both the history and language of the First Amendment support the view that the press must be left free to publish news, whatever the source, without censorship, injunctions, or prior restraints” (id. at 717).
Though ordinarily trials and judicial proceedings are open to the public view and the public has an interest in the disclosure of court records, the public’s right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute nor unrestricted and is a matter of judicial discretion (Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc., 435 US 589, 597 [1978]; Matter of Crain Communications v Hughes, 135 AD2d 351 [1987], affd 74 NY2d 626 [1989]).
The cross motions by the respondent, Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District, are brought to seal the entire court record pursuant to 22 NYCRR 216.1 (a), which provides as follows:
“Except where otherwise provided by statute or rule, a court shall not enter an order in any action or proceeding sealing the court records, whether in whole or in part, except upon a written finding of good cause, which shall specify the grounds thereof. In determining whether good cause has been shown, the court shall consider the interests of the public as well as of the parties.”
Confidentiality is the exception and not the rule, and the court is always required to make an independent determination of good cause (Matter of Hofmann, 284 AD2d 92, 93-94 [2001]). The enactment of 22 NYCRR 216.1 (a) was largely a response to a concern that, in cases in which the parties were in agreement to seal the records, the courts were not sufficiently taking into account the public interest and exercising their discretion to override the parties’ wishes (Matter of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 190 AD2d 483, 485-486 [1993]). The presumption against the sealing of court records remains unless there is a showing of good cause by the movant showing that the confidentiality of the parties outweighs the public interest in the proceedings (22 NYCRR 216.1; Matter of Hofmann, supra; People v Burton, 189 AD2d 532 [1993]). Although no precise test governs a finding of “good cause,” a court must determine whether good cause exists on a case-by-case basis, according to the facts (Matter of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., supra). A showing of “good cause” presupposes a showing that public access to the records is likely to harm a compelling interest to the movant (Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside County, 464 US 501, 510 [1984]), and no alternative to sealing can adequately protect the threatened interest (see, Application of The Herald Co., 734 F2d 93 [1984]). If no adequate alternative exists, movant must show that the narrowing of a sealing order is insufficient to protect the interest (see, Herald Co. v Burke, 261 AD2d 92 [1999]; see, e.g., Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v Virginia, 448 US 555, 581 [1980]) and that the sealing order would not be futile. If the information sought to be sealed is already a matter of public record and is demonstrably of public interest, then the sealing of the record is inappropriate (see, New York Times Co. v United States, 403 US 713, 733 [1971]; see, Coopersmith v Gold, 156 Misc 2d 594 [1992]).
The respondent Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District’s argument for sealing of the entire court record is predicated solely upon a claim to preserve the confidentiality of the petitioners who are alleged victims of sexual crimes pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 50-b. Civil Rights Law § 50-b prohibits public officials and public employees from the unauthorized disclosure of the identity of victims of sex crimes. Civil Rights Law § 50-b does not justify a blanket denial of a request for any documents relating to a sex crime but is limited only to documents “that tend[ ] to identify the victim of a sex crime” (Fappiano v New York City Police Dept., 95 NY2d 738, 748 [2001]).
Privacy is a limited right, which is not recognized in New York common law (Roberson v Rochester Folding Box Co., 171 NY 538 [1902]) and exists only to the extent created by statute (Messenger v Gruner + Jahr Print. & Publ., 94 NY2d 436 [2000]; Stephano v News Group Publs., 64 NY2d 174 [1984]). Civil Rights Law § 50-b provides a limited statutory right of privacy to a specific class of individuals, namely, victims of sex crimes. The respondent does not fall within the class of individuals protected by the statute.
The petitioners, who are the alleged sex crime victims and therefore have the private right to privacy under Civil Rights Law § 50-b, have submitted written papers opposing the sealing of the court records in the interest of the public. The respondent, Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District, has not shown any statutory right to privacy that enures to the benefit of the respondent, and the public has an interest in the proceedings soon to be brought before the court. In balancing the interests of the parties with those of the public, at this juncture, it is clear that the right of the public to be informed of the allegations in these papers far outweighs the rights of the parties. Aside from the numerous media reports, there have been community hearings and rallies attended by concerned parents and other community members. The safety of students participating in sports in the public school system is of paramount interest to the public. Therefore, no compelling interest to seal the entire file has been demonstrated by respondent (Matter of Hofmann, supra).
Respondent has also failed to show that there is no other alternative than sealing the entire record. The petitioners have already taken steps to conceal the identity of the petitioners and family members by petitioning the court to proceed anonymously with the filing of the notices of claims. The court will extend that application to include all court documents filed with the court without resorting to the overly broad sealing of the entire record since the court is vested with inherent plenary power to fashion a remedy necessary for the proper administration of justice (People v Beaudoin, 102 AD2d 359, 363 [1984]). The court granting a party the right to proceed anonymously is not the equivalent of sealing records and does not prevent the public from accessing court records (Anonymous v Anonymous, 191 Misc 2d 707 [2002]).
Finally, respondent has not shown the effectiveness of issuing a sealing order at this time. As Newsday, Inc. has indicated in its papers, the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged sex crimes has been discussed at length in the media. The identities of the alleged offenders have already been published in the media, and the identities of the alleged victims is already known to the press. The mere fact that embarrassing allegations may be made against the respondent, Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District, or other parties to the litigation, even if ultimately found to be without merit, is not a sufficient basis for a sealing order (.Matter of Hofmann, supra at 95).
Accordingly, respondent has not been able to demonstrate good cause to seal the court records pursuant to 22 NYCRR 216.1, and the respondent’s motions for a sealing of the records are hereby denied.
Motion by Newsday, Inc. to intervene in opposition to the respondent’s motions to seal the court records is granted.
It is hereby ordered that the pseudonym names of the infant petitioners and their natural guardians that appear in the captions of the notice of claim shall also appear in the captions of the plenary action and shall also appear within the body of all documents filed with the court in order to protect the identity of the infant petitioners and the mothers and natural guardians of said infants.
Any document that bears the true names of the petitioners and/or their natural guardians or any document that tends to identify same shall be redacted by the party filing such document. The original unredacted document shall be retained by the party who has filed the redacted document for an in camera inspection by the court.",0

Lizbeth González, J.
This is the respondent’s third posteviction application. The respondent seeks to reargue and renew her second posteviction application, denied by this court after oral argument on July 31, 2003. Both parties are represented by counsel for the purpose of this application. Kodera Elliott and Howard River Is, the new tenants, are self-represented. |
Factual Background
The subject premises is located at 1165 East 229th Street, apartment 13F, at Edenwald Houses, a New York City public housing development in Bronx County. A default judgment in the underlying proceeding was entered in the petitioner’s favor on March 11, 2003. The respondent first appeared before the court on April 9, 2003. Pursuant to a stipulation negotiated between the parties that day, the respondent agreed to pay $2,420 on or before May 9, 2003.
The respondent thereafter filed an order to show cause to stop her imminent eviction on the ground that her application for a “one shot deal” was pending approval. The respondent failed to appear in court on June 9, 2003, the return} date, and her application was denied. The respondent filed a subsequent order to show cause and on July 7, 2003 appeared before Judge Elizabeth J. Tao. Her motion was denied for lack of merit on the grounds that (1) her application for a one shot deal had been denied, (2) the respondent had only recently applied for public assistance, (3) $3,080 was now owed in rent arrears through July 2003, and (4) no rent had been paid to satisfy the May 9, 2003 stipulation. Nevertheless, the order stayed the execution of the warrant of eviction through July 12, 2()03 in the interest of justice.
No rent was paid pursuant to Judge Tao’s order and the respondent was ousted from the premises. The respondent filed a posteviction application and appeared before the court on July 29, 2003. Although the respondent presented Department of Social Services (DSS) approval for payment of $3,080, the arrears owed through July 2003, she showed no ability to pay the eviction costs for the full eviction or legal fees. The petitioner opposed the respondent’s restoration to the premises under any circumstances given her (1) history of defaults, (2) poor rent history, and (3) insufficient funds. The court denied the respondent’s application for lack of merit.
On July 31, 2003, the respondent’s second posteviction application was heard. This time, the respondent showed DSS approval for the payment of all arrears, eviction costs and legal fees. In response to the court’s inquiry as to why no rent was paid for the past 14 months, however, the respondent merely replied she knew she had “a problem,” could now pay the rent and was willing to “go on probation” for a year. The petitioner vigorously renewed its opposition to the respondent’s motion. After careful consideration, the court ruled in the petitioner’s favor.
The respondent is now represented by counsel. In filing her motion to reargue and renew, the respondent seeks vacatur of this court’s July 31, 2003 decision and order, the final judgment and the warrant of eviction herein on the grounds that (1) funds are available to pay all arrears and eviction costs, (2) DSS funds were available to pay the respondent’s arrears on July 25, 2003, prior to her eviction, (3) the respondent’s failure to pay rent for 14 months was due to misguided but well-intentioned efforts to pay the arrears on her own, and (4) her ability to pay future rent is irrelevant in the context of a nonpayment proceeding. The petitioner opposes vacatur or modification of the July 31, 2003 order on the grounds that (1) a tenant’s rent history during the course of a nonpayment proceeding and ability to pay future rent may be reviewed in determining a posteviction application, and (2) there is no new evidence to consider.
Kodera Elliott and Howard Rivers are the new tenants of the subject premises. Ms. Elliott and Mr. Rivers appeared in court on August 18, 2003 and informed the court that they are willing to surrender their right to occupy the subject premises and wait until another New York City Housing Authority apartment becomes available.
Good Cause
The Civil Court may, in appropriate circumstances, vacate a warrant of eviction and restore a tenant to possession, even after the warrant has executed, where good cause is shown. (Matter of Brusco v Braun, 84 NY2d 6.74 [1994]; 102-116 Eighth Ave. Assoc. v Oyola, 299 AD2d 296 [1st Dept 2002].) Ratyer than be governed by a hard and fast formula, each posteviction application is entitled to a “sui generis inquiry devoted to the particular facts and circumstances of the case then before the court, including the extent of the delay and the nature and' amount of the payment default(s), as well as a delicate balancing of the equities between the parties.” (Parkchester Apts. Co. v Heim, 158 Misc 2d 982, 983-984 [App Term, 1st Dept 1993].) .
Unique factors taken into account in determining whether to restore a tenant to possession include willful default and substantial prejudice to the petitioner (14 Realty Corp. v Mendez, NYLJ, Oct. 9, 2002, at 22, col 1 [App Term, 1st Dept]); a poor payment history (Lexicon Realty, LLC v Wood, 2003 NY Slip Op 51212[U] [App Term, 1st Dept]); failure by a guardian ad litem to protect the interests of a disabled respondent (Pomeroy Co. v Thompson, NYLJ, Sept. 18, 2002, at 20, col 6 [Civ Ct, NY County, Schreiber, J.]); and the harmful effects of an eviction upon minor children (Linus Holding Corp. v Harrison, 2001 NY Slip Op 40616[U] [App Term, 1st Dept]). The court may scrutinize the duration of a tenancy, a tenajnt’s age or infirmities, DSS delays in approving the payment of alrrears and ability to pay future rent. (Parkchester Apts. Co. v Scott, 271 AD2d 273 [1st Dept 2000].) Restoration to a subject premises is also appropriate where DSS funds to pay the arrears are approved prior to a tenant’s eviction, but checks are not timely issued. (New York City Hous. Auth. v Bonelli, NYLJ, Feb. 5, 2001, at 26, col 1 [App Term, 1st Dept].)
The Appellate Term has approved the restoration of a tenant to possession where “her failure to timely pay the rent was due, at least in part, to attempts to obtain PSA assistance which ultimately failed,” on condition that the arrears anjd eviction costs are fully paid. (Sorkin u Salazar, NYLJ, Oct. 2Í, 2000, at 26, col 1 [App Term, 1st Dept].) This court granted a posteviction application where new facts were presented by newly retained counsel who established that the tenant, who had end-stage renal failure, fell into a “dreadful cycle” where he became ill, missed work, lost pay, accumulated arrears, worked overtime and became ill all over again. (Allerton Assoc. v Paschall, NYLJ, Dec. 5, 2001, at 20, col 4 [Civ Ct, Bronx County, González, J.].)
Motion to Reargue and Renew
A motion for leave to reargue is based upon matters of fact or law allegedly overlooked or misapprehended by the court in determining a prior motion: new facts may not be considered. (CPLR 2221 [d].) In contrast, a motion for leave to renew is based upon new facts that would change the original determination. Reasonable justification for the movant’s failure to timely present such facts must be presented. (CPLR 2221 [e].) The court, in determining a combined motion for leave to reargue and renew, decides each part of the motion as if separately made. (CPLR 2221 [f].)
This court determines, in reviewing the respondent’s motion to reargue, that the law was properly applied in its July 31, 2003 decision. The equities weighed strongly in the petitioner’s favor given the respondent’s poor rent history, her prior defaults in this proceeding, her failure to explain why no rent was paid for 14 months, and her “indifferent attitude” toward the timely payment of her arrears when questioned by the court.
The respondent’s motion to renew must be viewed differently. Like the motion before this court in Allerton Assoc. v Paschall (NYLJ, Dec. 5, 2001, at 20, col 4, supra), the respondent’s motion to renew provides the court with new facts supplied by the respondent’s recently retained attorney. Here, the respondent lost her job, obtained marginal employment and tried, for an extended period, to avoid seeking public assistance. Her efforts to obtain a rent arrears grant were unavailing. Significantly, DSS funds were approved on July 25, 2003 in the amount of $3,080, prior to the tenant’s ouster, which amount would have satisfied her arrears. However, like the tenant affected by DSS delays in New York City Hous. Auth. v Bonelli (NYLJ, Feb. 5, 2001, at 26, col 1, supra), Ms. Roque was unaware of the approval until July 28, 2003, after her eviction.
The court is also apprised, for the first time, that the respondent has a 15-year-old son and, like the Appellate Term in Linus Holding Corp. v Harrison (2001 NY Slip Op 40616[U], supra), takes into account the impact of the ouster on this minor child.
It is well established that a court “retains the power to grant relief, in appropriate circumstances, from its own judgments or orders, even after the execution of a warrant,” contingent on a showing of compelling facts and equities. (90 NY Jur 2d, Real Property § 251 [2001].) This equitable principle, embodied in CPLR 5015, is applicable to the New York Civil Court pursuant to CCA 212. For the reasons outlined above, this court denies the respondent’s motion to reargue and grants her motion to renew. The respondent shall be restored to possession forthwith upon payment of all arrears owed through August 2003, including eviction and moving costs, on or before September 5, 2003. If the arrears are paid in September, then the September rent must also be paid.",0
0171-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Jack M. Battaglia, J.
The simple description of the cause of action in this endorsed complaint, “failure to provide proper services,” belies the difficult legal and human issues that are presented by this claim by a daughter, on behalf of her incompetent mother, against the brother and wife who took the mother in, and against the agency that provided home care services.
Plaintiff Dorothy Jacobs is the guardian of the person and property of Sarah Newton (mother Newton), who is now 75 years old and resides in River Manor Care Home. As described in the order appointing Ms. Jacobs to serve as her mother’s guardian, mother Newton “suffered a stroke that has rendered her aphasic . . . she has partial paralysis, can no longer swallow . . . she is nonambulatory . . . her cognition is nonexistent. . . [and] she suffers from hyperthyroidism and vascular dementia.” From February 1998 until October 2001, mother Newton resided with her son, defendant Robert Newton, and his wife, defendant Joan Newton. During that period, she received home care services from defendant Rockaway Home Attendant Services, Inc., a licensed home care services agency. In October 2001, mother Newton was hospitalized for a month, and then transferred to the nursing home.
Ms. Jacobs alleges that mother Newton was neglected by Robert and Joan Newton and by Rockaway in that, among other things, she was not properly medicated, and was not given adequate food and water, with the result that she suffered serious physical harm. Ms. Jacobs was supported at trial in these charges by two sisters, Alice Gordon and Linda Newton-Watts. Of course, Mr. and Ms. Newton and Rockaway deny the allegations. The Newtons contend that this lawsuit is a manifestation of guilt on the part of Ms. Jacobs and her two sisters because they did not sufficiently attend to their mother when she was in a position to appreciate their attendance.
Before addressing the merits of this dispute, there are two threshold matters that require resolution: the status of the suit as against a defendant named as “Faye Baker,” who has not appeared, and a motion to dismiss by Rockaway based upon the failure of Ms. Jacobs, who is unrepresented by counsel, to designate her representative capacity in the summons with endorsed complaint.
Although known to Ms. Jacobs and Mr. and Ms. Newton as “Faye Baker,” it appears that the name of the home attendant who assisted mother Newton is Shazia Bakaralli. There are two affidavits of service, but neither is sufficient to establish jurisdiction over Ms. Baker/Bakaralli. An attempt to serve her at her purported residence was unsuccessful, the affidavit showing that the process server was told that “Faye Baker” did not reside at the address, and neither affixation nor mailing having taken place. Service was attempted twice at the office of defendant Rockaway, but the testimony at trial was that the attendant was no longer employed by Rockaway when service was attempted, and that no one from Rockaway delivered the summons with endorsed complaint to her. The claim is dismissed as against “Faye Baker,” without prejudice to refiling; this opinion will not address in terms the viability of a claim against the home attendant personally.
The summons with endorsed complaint is dated January 7, 2003, based upon an application for a pro se summons of the same date. “Dorothy Jacobs” is designated as plaintiff. An order appointing guardian of the person and property of Sarah Newton was signed by the Honorable Ariel E. Belen on November 12, 2002, and the commission issued on January 30, 2003 after Ms. Jacobs filed a suitable bond. “[I]n the absence of some express limitation, a cause of action in favor of an . . . incompetent, arising either under the common law or conferred by statute, may be prosecuted by a . . . special guardian.” (Kaplan v Kaplan, 256 NY 366, 367-368 [1931].) Here, Justice Belen’s order gives Ms. Jacobs the power to “defend or maintain any civil proceeding” on behalf of Sarah Newton.
Whether the addition to the caption of Ms. Jacobs’ representative capacity is deemed an amendment of the summons and pleadings, or the addition or substitution of a party, it is supported by the CPLR and case law. (See CPLR 305 [c]; 1003, 3025 [b]; JCD Farms v Juul-Nielsen, 300 AD2d 446 [2d Dept 2002]; Buonomo v Stalker, 40 AD2d 733 [3d Dept 1972]; Van der Stegen v Neuss, Hesslein & Co., 243 App Div 122, 131-132 [1st Dept 1934]; Bogart v Imports of Wantagh, 142 Misc 2d 105, 106-107 [Long Beach City Ct 1988]; Gutman v Branden, 65 Misc 2d 232, 232-233 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1971].)
No possible prejudice can result to defendants. A document introduced into evidence by Rockaway summarizes a telephone conversation on December 17, 2002 between Ms. Jacobs and a Rockaway representative, during which Ms. Jacobs apparently said that she would be filing a claim based upon neglect of her mother. The answer in person filed by Harold Moorer, Executive Director of Rockaway, although ineffective as an appearance by the corporation (see CPLR 321 [a]), shows that Mr. Moorer understood on January 28, 2003 that the action might relate to the services that Rockaway rendered to mother Newton. When the case was first on the calendar on February 21, it was conferenced both by this Judge’s court attorney and separately by volunteer mediators. More than three months before the trial on June 3, therefore, the parties knew that Ms. Jacobs was complaining about the neglect of mother Newton.
Recognizing, however, that Ms. Jacobs may pursue a claim on behalf of mother Newton does not mean that mother Newton has a viable claim against either her son and daughter-in-law or against the contractor that provided home care services. Those issues involve questions of duty and breach that do not appear to have been previously addressed by a New York court.
Duty/Robert and Joan Newton
In Gelbman v Gelbman (23 NY2d 434 [1969]), an action in negligence by a parent against her unemancipated son arising out of an automobile accident, the Court of Appeals abolished intrafamily immunity for nonwillful torts. The Court concluded that the policy basis for the defense, “preserving family unity,” would be better served by permitting the parent’s action. (See id. at 437.) The law already permitted suit against an emancipated child. (See Crosby v Crosby, 230 App Div 651, 652-653 [3d Dept 1930]; Becker v Rieck, 19 Misc 2d 104, 105 [Sup Ct, Onondaga County 1959], affd 13 AD2d 611 [4th Dept 1961].)
Again, however, removal of any bar of immunity does not establish that Mr. Newton or his wife breached any duty to mother Newton. “There was, at common law, no legal duty upon a child to support his parents.” (Matter of State Welfare Commr. v Mintz, 28 AD2d 14, 16 [2d Dept 1967]; see also Ulrich v Ulrich, 136 NY 120, 122-124 [1892]; Matter of Salm, 171 Misc 367, 370-371 [Sup Ct, NY County 1939], affd 258 App Div 875 [1st Dept 1939], affd 282 NY 765 [1940]; Rutecki v Lukaszewski, 273 App Div 638, 640 [4th Dept 1948].) There have been statutes imposing liability on a child for a parent’s support, which could be enforced by criminal or civil proceedings, including an action by the needy parent, but the most recent were repealed in the mid-1960s. (See Matter of State Welfare Commr. v Mintz, 28 AD2d at 16; Matter of Errico, 49 Misc 2d 1055, 1057 [Sur Ct, NY County 1966].)
The last of the statutes requiring a child to support a needy parent were repealed in connection with the then new Medicare program, in part to lift, what was deemed, a “burden of support.” (See Matter of State Welfare Commr. v Mintz, 28 AD2d at 17.) And so, “absent agreement or other definitive obligation, this State, as opposed to some others . . . does not hold a child liable for the support of his or her parent.” (Matter of Summers v D’Elia, 95 AD2d 184, 193-194 [2d Dept 1983].) Moreover, it is not at all clear that the statutory duty to support that once existed would encompass a duty to provide needed care or medical attention. (See State v Flontek, 82 Ohio St 3d 10, 13, 693 NE2d 767, 770 [1998] [“the duty . . . imposed by the statute is a purely financial one”].)
In the somewhat analogous arena of parental liability to a child, the Court of Appeals has held that “a child does not have a legally cognizable claim for damages against his parent for negligent supervision.” (See Holodook v Spencer, 36 NY2d 35, 40 [1974].) In addition to the “prevention of family discord and the correlative concern to preserve the family’s resources for the aid of all its members” (id. at 46), the Court noted other policy considerations that weighed against allowing the cause of action: “the potential for abuse of a negligent supervision claim when brought in a retaliatory context between estranged parents”; the “difficulty of judicial delimitation, either by court or by jury, of the bounds of the asserted right to supervision”; a danger of “circumscrib [ing] the wide range of discretion a parent ought to have in permitting his child to undertake responsibility and gain independence”; the “different economic, educational, cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds which must prevail”; and recognition that “[supervision is uniquely a matter for the exercise of judgment” (id. at 49-50).
The Court subsequently extended its reasoning to preclude a cause of action for negligent supervision “between unemancipated minor siblings.” (See Smith v Sapienza, 52 NY2d 82, 84 [1981].) But lower appellate courts have allowed the claim against grandparents with temporary custody and control (see Hadden v Kero-Sun, Inc., 197 AD2d 668, 668-669 [2d Dept 1993]), and even against a parent who voluntarily assumed a duty to supervise a child in a particular activity (see Young v Greenberg, 181 AD2d 492 [1st Dept 1992]). These latter results are consistent with the reality that the “law typically recognizes liability for breach of supervisory duty for those who afford child care in the shoes of parents” (see Allstate Ins. Co. v Reliance Ins. Co., 85 Misc 2d 734, 736-737 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1976]), and with broader principles of tort law that permit recovery for breach of a duty voluntarily assumed.
And so, “[e]ven without compensation, when defendants undertook to control a young child and provide care for her, they became responsible for her injury through their negligence.” (Zalak v Carroll, 15 NY2d 753, 754 [1965]; see also Appell v Mandel, 296 AD2d 514 [2d Dept 2002]; Mary A. ZZ. v Blasen, 284 AD2d 773, 775 [3d Dept 2001]; Diamond-Fisher v Greto, 276 AD2d 413 [1st Dept 2000]; Bartels v County of Westchester, 76 AD2d 517, 521-522 [2d Dept 1980]; Andrews v County of Otsego, 112 Misc 2d 37, 41-44 [Sup Ct, Otsego County 1982].) “The law is clear that, even when no original duty is owed to the plaintiff to undertake affirmative action, once it is voluntarily undertaken, it must be performed with due care.” (Parvi v City of Kingston, 41 NY2d 553, 559 [1977].) “[Assumption of the task . . . [is] assumption of [the] duty.” (Glanzer v Shepard, 233 NY 236, 239 [1922].)
In other states, assumption of responsibility for the care of an elderly person can create a common-law duty that is breached when neglect results in harm, and supports criminal liability either under general criminal statutes (see Commonwealth v Pestinikas, 421 Pa Super 371, 617 A2d 1339 [1992]; Davis v Commonwealth, 230 Va 201, 335 SE2d 375 [1985]; State v Brown, 129 Ariz 347, 631 P2d 129 [1981]; Jones v United States, 308 F2d 307 [1962]), or under statutes that specifically penalize the neglect of elderly persons (see Peterson v State, 765 So 2d 861 [Fla 2000]; People v Manis, 10 Cal App 4th 110, 12 Cal Rptr 2d 619 [1992]; but see Billingslea v State, 780 SW2d 271 [Tex Crim App 1989] [common-law duty insufficient, statutory duty required for criminal liability]).
In New York, until recently, there was no statute that specifically penalized the causing of harm to an elderly person. Effective November 1, 1998, as will be described more fully below, it is a crime to endanger the welfare of an elderly person, as defined in Penal Law §§ 260.32 and 260.34. Before that, no reported decision found by this court applied the general criminal law to harm caused to an elderly person. There are numerous decisions, however, in which criminal liability was based upon harm to a child by a person not the child’s parent who assumed responsibility for the child’s care, even if only for a short period of time. (See People v Carroll, 93 NY2d 564, 569 [1999]; People v Wong, 81 NY2d 600, 607-608 [1993]; People v Sheffield, 265 AD2d 258, 259 [1st Dept 1999]; People v Goddard, 206 AD2d 653, 655 [3d Dept 1994]; People v Salley, 153 AD2d 704, 705 [2d Dept 1989].) More than a century ago, a “defendant, having the charge of the infant child named, did unlawfully and feloniously suffer and permit the death of the child, by willfully neglecting, without lawful excuse, to supply it with proper food, clothing, and care.” (People v McDonald, 1 NYS 703, 704 [Sup Ct, 5th Dept 1888].)
In People v Flayhart (72 NY2d 737 [1988]), a husband and wife were found guilty of criminal homicide of the husband’s brother, who “was mentally retarded and afflicted with a number of ailments,” when he “died of neglect while he was living in [their] home and was totally dependent upon their care” (see id. at 740). The result should not be surprising in a state that imposes criminal liability for malnutrition of a horse. (See People v Arcidicono, 79 Misc 2d 242 [App Term, 2d Dept 1974].)
“A person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a vulnerable elderly person in the first degree when, being a caregiver for a vulnerable elderly person . . .
“[w]ith intent to cause physical injury to such person, he or she causes serious physical injury to such person; or . . .
“[h]e or she recklessly causes serious physical injury to such person.” (Penal Law § 260.34.)
A second degree crime is defined when the caregiver intentionally or recklessly causes physical injury that is not serious, or
“[w]ith criminal negligence, he or she causes physical injury to [a vulnerable elderly] person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument; or . . .
“[he] or she subjects such person to sexual contact without the latter’s consent.” (Penal Law § 260.32 [3], [4].)
The statute defines a “caregiver” as a “person who (i) assumes responsibility for the care of a vulnerable elderly person pursuant to a court order; or (ii) receives monetary or other valuable consideration for providing care for a vulnerable elderly person”; and defines a “vulnerable elderly person” as a “person sixty years of age or older who is suffering from a disease or infirmity associated with advanced age and manifested by demonstrable physical, mental or emotional dysfunction to the extent that the person is incapable of adequately providing for his or her own health or personal care.” (Penal Law § 260.30 [1], [3].)
Although the criminal statute is new, the fundamental concept of duty on which it is based is not. In Thibault v Franzese (24 AD2d 903 [2d Dept 1965]), the Second Department held that the “defendants’ duty to use reasonable care to protect the plaintiff ... a 73-year old senile woman, whom . . . the defendants had undertaken to care for while she was in their home, was not measured by what their duty would have been to a social guest as a mere licensee . . . They were required to use reasonable care to protect her from injury” (see also Tooker v Tooker, 193 AD2d 563, 563 [1st Dept 1993]).
This court has little difficulty in concluding that a child who assumes responsibility for the care of a parent who is limited by age or illness, or both, owes a duty to the parent to use reasonable care, and will be liable for harm caused by the failure to use reasonable care by affirmative act or omission. The conclusion is supported by “common concepts of morality [and] logic.” (See Tenuto v Lederle Labs., Div. of Am. Cyanamid Co., 90 NY2d 606, 612 [1997].)
It is unnecessary and would, perhaps, even be inappropriate, for this court to generally define the circumstances that would constitute an assumption of duty or might qualify the parent as sufficiently “dependent” or “vulnerable.” Here, mother Newton resided with her son and daughter-in-law, and, as will appear, they took control of all of her income, presumably to use for her benefit. Because of her physical and mental condition, mother Newton was progressively dependent upon Robert and Joan Newton, and upon the home care attendant that she herself could not effectively supervise, for all of her medical, nutritional and other personal needs. Also, although not determinative, and without suggesting that they acted inappropriately, there was testimony that Robert and Joan inhibited or discouraged participation by Robert’s siblings, with the potential consequence at the least of mother Newton’s further dependence on Robert’s and Joan’s care.
The elements of breach of duty and harm will be addressed below. For now it is enough to say that the court finds helpful an approach suggested by Judge Fuchsberg for assessing a parent’s duty to supervise a child. “What would an ordinarily reasonable and prudent person — taking into account the parent-child relationship — have done in similar circumstances?” (Nolechek v Gesuale, 46 NY2d 332, 346 [1978] [Fuchsberg, J., concurring].) “A mere misjudgment in supervisi[on] . . . would not necessarily constitute a tortious breach of duty.” (Id.) Rather, the facts and circumstances to be considered, in addition to the parent/child relationship, would include the “practical responsibilities, expectations and limitations that flow” from the relationship; the “judgmental nature of the decisions” that must be made; the “age, mental and physical health . . . aptitudes and needs” of the parent; the “presence in the family of . . . children competing for . . . time and attention”; and the “economic social and physical environment in which the . . . conduct occurs.” (Id. at 347.) Also highly important would be consideration of the resources available to assist in the care of the parent, and the limitations of those resources.
The court is mindful that many of the considerations that led the Court of Appeals to refuse to recognize a child’s claim for negligent supervision by a parent would resonate as well on a parent’s claim for neglect by a child. And this court is well aware that the individuals before it are siblings, necessarily exercising their own feelings and conflicts as they argue the interests of mother Newton. But the court believes that these concerns can be ameliorated by careful attention to the many factors balanced on a determination of breach of duty. “Where . . . duty is breached, only the most cogent reasons of public policy should warrant denial of a remedy and consequent deviation from the central principle of Anglo-American tort law, which is that wrongdoers should bear the losses they cause.” (Holodook v Spencer, 36 NY2d at 52 [Jasen, J., dissenting].) Duty/Rockaway Home Attendant Services, Inc.
According to the New York State Association of Health Care Providers, Inc.:
“New York’s Medicaid home care program provides [a] wide range of services to over 186,000 home-bound sick and elderly patients throughout the State (2000 data) while over 176,000 New Yorkers receive home care funded by the federal Medicare Program (2000 data). And of course, thousands of New York State residents purchase home care services privately and others receive home care services through private insurance coverage in both indemnity and managed care benefit plans . . .
“All together, there are approximately 900 home care agencies in New York State, employing over 250,000 workers. In addition to professional nurses, therapists, and assistants, home care agencies hire and train workers as home health aides and personal care aides.” (New York State Association of Health Care Providers, Inc., What is Home Care?, dated Jan. 2003 <http://www.nyshcp.org/ about_home_care.shtml> [accessed July 1, 2003].)
The association advises that “we should expect to see increasing levels of home care utilization ... as a result of shifting utilization away from more costly settings into home care.” (Id.)
The New York Legislature has declared that the “provision of high quality home care services to residents of New York state is a priority concern” (Public Health Law § 3600), and mandated the regulation of home care services as they are provided by, among others, licensed home care services agencies and certified home health agencies. (See Public Health Law § 3600 et seq.\ 10 NYCRR parts 763, 766 [Department of Health Rules and Regulations].) When home care services are provided pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs, there is additional regulatory involvement by federal and local authorities, including the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the City Human Resources Administration (HRA). (See Kuppersmith v Dowling, 93 NY2d 90, 93-95 [1999].)
Generally, the institutional custodian of a person with physical or mental limitations owes a duty of reasonable care to protect the person from injury, with the “degree of care owed . . . commensurate with the [person’s] capacity to provide for his or her own safety.” (See Killeen v State of New York, 66 NY2d 850, 852 [1985]; see also N.X. v Cabrini Med. Ctr., 97 NY2d 247, 253 [2002] [referring to a “sliding scale of duty”]; Campbell v Cluster Hous. Dev. Fund Co., 247 AD2d 353, 354 [2d Dept 1998] [“The degree of reasonable care is measured by the plaintiff’s physical and mental infirmities, as known by the defendants”]; Reavey v State of New York, 125 AD2d 656, 657 [2d Dept 1986].)
Relying upon these authorities, the Second Department has held that home care agencies may be liable when an elderly person or a person with a disability suffers traumatic injury because a home care attendant was either not present when she/he should have been or was not sufficiently attentive. (See Esposito v Personal Touch Home Care, 288 AD2d 337, 338 [2d Dept 2001]; Villarin v Onobanjo, 276 AD2d 479, 480 [2d Dept 2000]; Willis v City of New York, 266 AD2d 207, 208 [2d Dept 1999]; Calick v Double A Prop. Assoc., 251 AD2d 278, 279-280 [2d Dept 1998]; see also Lee v Health Force, 268 AD2d 564 [2d Dept 2000].)
Virtually all of the decided cases have involved traumatic injury. “The overwhelming majority of civil cases against nursing homes arising from the treatment of residents involve falls.” (Eads v Heritage Enters., 204 Ill 2d 92, 106-107, 787 NE2d 771, 779 [2003].) But in Goldberg v Plaza Nursing Home Comp. (222 AD2d 1082 [4th Dept 1995], overruled in part on other grounds by Doe v Westfall Health Care Ctr., 303 AD2d 102, 109 [4th Dept 2002]), the Court recognized a claim based on negligence when the failure of nursing home personnel to respond to a patient’s call for help may have resulted in confusion, agitation, and cardiac arrest.
By statute, New York makes a residential health care facility liable to any patient for the deprivation of “any right or benefit created or established for the well-being of the patient by the terms of any contract,” or by any federal or state statute, code, rule or regulation; “as an affirmative defense,” the facility may establish that it “exercised all care reasonably necessary to prevent and limit the deprivation and injury.” (Public Health Law § 2801-d [1].) The statute provides for “minimum damages” of 25% of the “daily per-patient rate of payment” established for the facility, as well as attorney fees. (Public Health Law § 2801-d [2], [4], [6].)
“[T]he clear intent of [this statute] was to expand the existing remedies for conduct that, although constituting grievous and actionable violations of important rights, did not give rise to damages of sufficient monetary value to justify litigation.” (Doe v Westfall Health Care Ctr., 303 AD2d at 109.) The “statutory basis for liability is neither deviation from accepted standards of medical practice nor breach of a duty of care,” but rather the “deprivation of a right conferred by contract, statute, regulation, code or rule.” (Zeides v Hebrew Home for Aged at Riverdale, 300 AD2d 178, 179 [1st Dept 2002].) A cognizable cause of action can be based on the failure to prevent the development of pressure sores and the failure to maintain adequate nutrition. (See id.; see also 10 NYCRR 415.12 [c], [i].)
Like this statute, the developing common law should recognize the “vulnerability and dependence of abused or neglected elders, especially those whose infirmities — mental or physical— leave them at the mercy of their caregivers and those who are physically isolated in their own homes or the homes of their relatives.” (Easton v Sutter Coast Hosp., 80 Cal App 4th 485, 494, 95 Cal Rptr 2d 316, 322 [2000].) There is no reason in principle to limit the duty of a home care provider to the prevention of traumatic injury, thereby excluding liability for longer-term neglect that can have even more serious consequences. A provider should at least be liable for the failure to discharge those duties that it contractually undertook to discharge. (See Doe v Westfall Health Care Ctr., 303 AD2d at 107-108; see also Matter of Pesante v County of Seneca, 2002 NY Slip Op 40503[U], *6, 12 [Sup Ct, Seneca County].)
Breach of Duty
Prior to moving into the second-floor apartment in the building owned by her son and daughter-in-law (Mr. and Ms. Newton lived in the first-floor apartment), mother Newton was receiving home care services from United States Home Care three days each week, four hours each. day. Rockaway’s home attendant task assignment sheet for mother Newton dated February 13, 1998 shows that, initially, home care services were provided by Rockaway on the same schedule. (Rockaway introduced into evidence as a business record what it represented to be mother Newton’s complete file.) The assignment sheet noted mother Newton’s limited mobility and forgetfulness.
In medical requests for home care dated November 4, 1999, November 14, 2000, and February 22, 2001, mother Newton’s doctor recommended increases in home care services. The 2001 request states:
“Presently, Mrs. Newton is receiving 4 hours a day 7 days a week. During the hours of 1 PM and 7 PM, Mrs. Newton is home alone which makes it quite dangerous for a woman with her mental and physical limitations. Please increase her hours that she would have eight hours a day, 5 days a week and 4 hours on Saturdays and Sundays.”
Mother Newton’s home care services were increased to the level recommended by her doctor. According to Ms. Jacobs, these services were paid for by Medicare and Medicaid, but mother Newton was required to pay $24 each month.
Mother Newton moved at some point from the second-floor apartment to the first floor, where she was given the master bedroom with bath in Mr. and Ms. Newton’s apartment. There she stayed until she was hospitalized in late October 2001. Ms. Jacobs contends that neglect by Mr. and Ms. Newton and Rock-away in failing to properly medicate, feed and hydrate mother Newton caused the serious deterioration in her condition that required hospitalization. Ms. Jacobs presented hospital records apparently from New York Methodist Hospital and a statement from a Dr. Alan R Goldman, but the hospital records are not certified, and the doctor’s statement is not sworn to or affirmed. None are admissible as evidence to establish mother Newton’s physical or mental condition.
Because Ms. Jacobs is not represented by counsel, it is not surprising that she has not presented evidence in admissible form. Her pro se status, however, does not relieve her of any requirement that there be expert medical opinion in admissible evidentiary form to establish mother Newton’s physical and mental condition and any causative factors that may have been contributed by defendants. (See Duffen v State of New York, 245 AD2d 653, 653-654 [3d Dept 1997]; Redding v Saunders, 213 AD2d 1015 [4th Dept 1995]; Sabatino v Albany Med. Ctr. Hosp., 187 AD2d 777, 778 [3d Dept 1992]; see also Banushi v Lambrakos, 305 AD2d 524 [2d Dept 2003]; Roundtree v Singh, 143 AD2d 995, 996 [2d Dept 1988].)
Ms. Jacobs, her husband, and her two sisters, Alice Gordon and Linda Newton-Watts, testified to occasions when they visited mother Newton and found her alone, or telephoned without response. Ms. Jacobs testified that she visited her mother every other week, twice each week, once on a weekday and once on the weekend. She found her mother alone at times that, she believed, the home attendant should have been there, but Ms. Jacobs did not quantify these incidents or specify when they occurred. Ms. Gordon testified to four visits during the year 2000 when she visited on a weekday during the home attendant’s scheduled hours and found her mother alone. She told of a Saturday visit when the home attendant should have been present, but she found her mother alone in circumstances that can be described as unpleasant and degrading. Ms. Gordon would also find her mother alone in the evening before Mr. and Ms. Newton returned from work, having obtained the key from the home attendant, who lived nearby. Ms. Newton-Watts testified to visits twice each month, and to finding her mother alone approximately six times. It is not clear that these occasions were during the home attendant’s hours. All three sisters testified that Mr. and Ms. Newton discouraged visits and placed restrictions that prevented the sisters from doing more for their mother.
In addition to the home attendant’s absences, both Ms. Jacobs and Ms. Gordon were concerned about their mother’s eating. Mother Newton was “always hungry,” but she would be found with cold food on a tray. Ms. Jacobs acknowledged that mother Newton could be difficult about food and that, as her condition worsened, it was necessary to put food (and her medications) in her mouth. The sisters spoke to the home attendant about their concerns. After mother Newton was hospitalized, Ms. Jacobs discovered that her $120/month food subsidy had gone unused to the extent of a $370 credit.
Ms. Jacobs testified that she also learned when her mother was hospitalized that mother Newton had not urinated in a week because of dehydration, and that she had not been given her thyroid medication for six months. But Ms. Jacobs introduced no admissible evidence of mother Newton’s medical condition. The issue of the medications is in any event complicated, because of the restrictions placed on a home attendant’s authority to medicate a client. The medication agreement form that mother Newton signed at the inception of the services states that she was aware that home attendants “do not administer medications. However, if medications are prepoured, they would assist the client by handing the container to the client at the appropriate hour.”
Mother Newton was receiving on a monthly basis a Social Security benefit of $573, a pension payment of $74 and a food stamp subsidy of $120. At first, she maintained a joint bank account with Ms. Jacobs, but at some point, apparently at the bank’s suggestion, the account was changed or replaced by an account with Ms. Newton. Mr. and Ms. Newton apparently used some money that mother Newton received on the death of a son to assist in the purchase of the two-family house in which they all lived. Ms. Jacobs acknowledged that she agreed to Ms. Newton’s taking responsibility for mother Newton’s financial matters, and mother Newton apparently understood and agreed to the circumstances of her moving in with her son and daughter-in-law. The court does not understand Ms. Jacobs to be alleging any serious financial impropriety on the part of Mr. and Ms. Newton. Rather, Ms. Jacobs suggested that the additional income caused Mr. and Ms. Newton to keep mother Newton with them, even though they were not able or willing to properly care for her.
Ms. Jacobs testified to bruising on mother Newton’s upper arms, and Ms. Newton-Watts said her brother had once told her mother Newton had fallen when the home attendant was not present. However, all acknowledged that mother Newton is a large woman with progressively limited mobility as her physical and medical condition deteriorated. It does not appear that any of the sisters suspected abuse or intentional mistreatment, and the court does not understand Ms. Jacobs to be alleging any. The court is satisfied, having seen and heard from Mr. and Ms. Newton, that nothing like that occurred.
The three sisters testified that they spoke to Mr. and Ms. Newton about the home attendant’s absences and their other concerns, but they were assured that there was no need for worry, and were discouraged from complaining because the Newtons were reluctant to look for another home attendant. Ms. Jacobs did call Rockaway twice, but, because of the Newtons’ urging, she only inquired about services and schedules, rather than making a complaint. Ms. Gordon also called Rockaway after the unpleasant Saturday incident.
As might be expected, much of the testimony of the three sisters or its significance was disputed by Mr. and Ms. Newton and Rockaway. The Newtons dispute the sisters’ accounts of regular visits, and dispute their contention that visits were discouraged. To the contrary, the Newtons claim that they urged the sisters to visit more often, but that they received “limited cooperation” from the sisters. The Newtons also dispute that the sisters complained to them about the home attendant’s absence, contending that, in any event, the sisters would visit at times when the home attendant was not scheduled to be there. According to the Newtons, it was not until after mother Newton was hospitalized, when the doctors questioned whether she had been receiving her medications, that anyone complained about the home attendant’s absence. The Newtons say that sister Linda even complimented them on mother Newton’s care.
As for the home attendant, the Newtons considered her “not the best” but “pretty good.” Mr. Newton acknowledged that he, too, had telephoned and not received a response, but noted that the home attendant did food shopping and ran errands as part of her duties. Both Mr. and Ms. Newton stressed that, had the home attendant or Rockaway not performed, they would have taken action. They saw no sudden deterioration in mother Newton’s condition, but rather the effects of a progressive debilitating illness over the four years mother Newton was with them. Mother Newton could also be “stubborn” or “uncooperative” at times.
Harold Moorer, Rockaway’s Executive Director since April 2000, testified on its behalf. Rockaway employs approximately 1,000 home attendants, and provides home care services under contract with New York City’s Human Resources Administration to approximately 200 Medicaid recipients. The home attendants receive 44 hours of training and are “supervised” by a nurse. Consistent with the medication agreement form, described above, Mr. Moorer stressed the home attendant’s limited involvement with the client’s medications. Mr. Moorer explained that the initial home attendant task assignment sheet for mother Newton was prepared in accordance with HRA requirements after an in-home assessment by a registered nurse, but that HRA determined the level of service. Mr. Moorer also testified that there was a reevaluation and summary report by a nurse every six months, again in accordance with HRA requirements. However, the filé that Rockaway introduced as mother Newton’s complete file contains only one nurse’s supervisory visit report, detailing a visit on August 14, 2001. The report will be discussed below.
Mr. Moorer described a computerized time-tracking system for the home attendants, recording the time of telephone calls from the client’s premises when the home attendant arrives and departs. The time records for mother Newton’s home attendant indicated no problems, but, of course, the system only provides assurance as to the home attendant’s presence at the starting and ending times. Mr. Moorer also testified that, until a December 2002 telephone call from Ms. Jacobs, Rockaway received no complaints about the home attendant’s absence during her scheduled hours or about the quality of her services.
Mother Newton’s file also contains a client contact record that summarizes monthly “calls,” presumably by telephone, by a “personnel specialist” to the client’s premises. The form does not indicate to whom the caller spoke, but records whether or not the “client and/or family” is satisfied with the service and the home attendant. The client contact record from mother Newton’s “complete” file shows monthly contacts from July 2000 through November 2001, during which the caller noted that the client was doing “well” or “fine” and was “happy” or “satisfied” with the home attendant. The client contact record is problematic, however, because there is evidence that one of the entries may have been falsified. The final entry is dated November 12, 2001, and indicates satisfaction with the home attendant and the service and that the “client and H/A doing fine.” But the file also contains a client update form that states that mother Newton was hospitalized at Methodist on October 23, 2001 and that date was the last date of service to the client. (The home attendant’s time records show service through October 29, which is more consistent with the hospital records.)
The medical opinions contained in the nurse’s supervisory visit report on the August 2001 visit are probably admissible as part of Rockaway’s business records. (See Bruce-Bishop v Jafar, 302 AD2d 345 [2d Dept 2003]; Cohn v Haddad, 244 AD2d 519 [2d Dept 1997].) In any event, the report was introduced by Rockaway, and at the least would show notice to Rockaway of the information and opinions stated. The report’s general conclusion is that the “client needs assistance with all activities.” The report notes no “evidence” of, among other things, bedsores/skin lesions, poor nutrition, emaciation, or dehydration, and recommends a “continu[ation] [of the] current level of care.” The report is somewhat problematic in that it notes “self-endangering behavior,” but for “action taken and recommended follow up” states “none at this time.” The report also notes that the “client lives alone in apt on 2nd floor” and “needs the assistance of HA with all activities to ensure safety.” Nothing in the report indicates that any consideration was given to mother Newton’s safety during the times when the home attendant was not present. The nurse indicated a next visit in November, but apparently mother Newton was hospitalized before another visit.
In assessing whether Mr. and Ms. Newton or Rockaway breached a duty of reasonable care, any alleged failure to properly medicate mother Newton must be set aside. There is no direct evidence that mother Newton did not in fact receive her medications, nor any admissible evidence that would support the inference that she was not properly medicated. The court must note, however, that, had there been such evidence, Rockaway’s reliance on the limited authority of home care attendants with respect to medications would not relieve it of all responsibility for the consequences. With awareness of an elderly person’s failure to take medication, whether as a result of stubbornness, forgetfulness, difficulty swallowing, lack of preparation by a relative, or any other reason, reasonable care would require some action, and no medical evidence or other expert evidence would be necessary for a factfinder to so conclude.
With respect to any alleged malnutrition or dehydration, again, there is no admissible evidence that mother Newton suffered from these conditions. Moreover, as to Mr. and Ms. Newton, there was no expert testimony that “physical manifestations of dehydration and undernutrition” would be “readily apparent.” (See People v Manon, 226 AD2d 774, 776 [3d Dept 1996]; People v Salley, 153 AD2d 704, 705 [2d Dept 1989]; People v Stubbs, 122 AD2d 91, 91-92 [2d Dept 1986].) Expert testimony would be even more crucial to any claim that the Newtons should have known that mother Newton was not receiving her medications, absent direct evidence. Moreover, accepting the testimony of Ms. Jacobs and her sisters as to the frequency of their visits, if there were any “readily apparent” signs of malnutrition, dehydration, or failure to medicate, they, too, presumably would have seen them and they would have taken action.
Rockaway stands on different footing. Although the Newtons were “not in the class of individuals either possessing or under a legal obligation to procure” specialized medical knowledge (see People v Goddard, 206 AD2d 653, 655 [3d Dept 1994]), the same cannot as readily be said of Rockaway’s nurses or even its home attendants. An exploration of the issue must await a more appropriate case, one in which there is medical evidence that the condition existed, as well as a showing as to the regulatory requirements and limitations imposed on home care services.
As to the alleged absence of the home attendant during scheduled hours, neither medical nor other expert testimony is required when there is a “fail[ure] to provide that level of supervision called for in . . . [the] treatment plan.” (See Angell v State of New York, 278 AD2d 776, 778 [3d Dept 2000].) Based upon all of the evidence, the court concludes that there probably were occasions on which the home attendant was not present with mother Newton when she should have been, although the court is not convinced that the Newtons understood that a problem existed. The real question, however, is harm. Unlike the cases in which a traumatic injury occurs during the home attendant’s absence, there is no link here between any one or combination of absences and any consequence to mother Newton. Only the Saturday incident that Ms. Gordon testified about would qualify as evidence of discomfort or indignity. But, without mother Newton’s testimony, it is difficult for the court to assess how she might have perceived the situation at that time, or generally when she was left alone.
Mother Newton was apparently alone often, not only when the home attendant was absent during her scheduled hours, but also at those times when her attendant was not scheduled and the Newtons had yet to return from work. Considering all of the evidence, the court sees a serious question as to whether the Newtons and Rockaway “through the conduct of its employee^],” including the home attendant (see Willis v City of New York, 266 AD2d at 208), either failed to recognize that mother Newton required a greater level of care, at home or elsewhere, or to take appropriate action in response.
In considering whether the Newtons or Rockaway breached a duty of reasonable care to mother Newton in their assessment of an appropriate level and locus of care for mother Newton, the factors to be weighed differ somewhat because of their respective roles. The policy concerns articulated by the Court of Appeals in deciding not to recognize a cause of action by a child against a parent for negligent supervision are, of course, most pertinent when the duty of the Newtons is at issue. Concerns about cultural differences, economic realities, family and other demands, and the elusive qualities of judgment are present here as well. These factors are particularly difficult to weigh by strangers when the choice might be between continued care at home and institutionalization.
Under Mental Hygiene Law § 81.22 (a) (9), a guardian is given the power to “choose the place of abode” of the incapacitated person, but “placement of the incapacitated person in a nursing home or residential care facility ... or other similar facility shall not be authorized without the consent of the incapacitated person so long as it is reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the incapacitated person in the community, preferably in the home of the incapacitated person.” That decision is made in the context of a “clear statutory mandate that [the incapacitated person’s] preferences, wishes and desires should be given great weight ... in light of [the incapacitated person’s] functional level, understanding and appreciation of her functional level.” (Matter of McNally, 194 Misc 2d 793, 795 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County 2003].)
Moreover: “A guardian’s performance in money matters can be watched and evaluated in objective terms. This is not so in family matters. Only under careful judicial scrutiny should guardians ... be allowed to tamper with family relationships in the name of the ward’s best interest.” (Pettas v Pettas, 88 Misc 2d 955, 957 [Sup Ct, Nassau County 1976].) These considerations are highly significant when we do not have any evidence of the wishes of mother Newton, and the question is raised in a civil action on her behalf against the son and daughter-in-law who watched over her, perhaps imperfectly, for four years of progressively debilitating illness.
Whether it is the Newtons’ or Rockaway’s conduct that is being evaluated, to the extent that the alleged breach of duty involves improper assessment of mother Newton’s mental and physical condition, rather than “common sense and judgment,” expert testimony is required. (See Reardon v Presbyterian Hosp. in City of N.Y., 292 AD2d 235, 237 [1st Dept 2002]; see also Angell v State of New York, 278 AD2d at 778.) Beyond that, particularly with respect to Rockaway, and subject to regulatory requirements, “[t]he evaluation of the appropriate level of supervision implicates the professional standard of care . . . and, as such, must be proven by expert testimony.” (Amadon v State of New York, 182 AD2d 955, 957 [3d Dept 1992]; see also Cruz v Alhambra Day Treatment Ctr., 2003 NY Slip Op 50909[U], *2 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists 2003]; Caulfield v Kitsap County, 108 Wash App 242, 257, 29 P3d 738, 745 [2001] [home care].) The issue is the “standard of care customarily exercised [by] similar facilities in the community.” (Yamin v Baghel, 284 AD2d 778, 779 [3d Dept 2001].)
There is a “complex, multifaceted reality of providing personal care services to those in need,” and a “home care assessment . . . requires complementary analyses and opinions from individuals with different fields of expertise.” (Kuppersmith v Dowling, 93 NY2d 90, 97 [1999].) In this case, the court has no information as to the availability or cost of additional care for mother Newton in the home, the practical availability of financial resources in the family or through government subsidy, or the alternatives to home care and the practical and financial availability of those alternatives.
The most that can be said on this record, and in the exercise of “common sense and judgment,” is that the Newtons and Rockaway failed to see that mother Newton might require additional care, and, therefore, failed to make a fuller assessment of her needs and the means for meeting them. For Rock-away in particular this is more than it should find satisfactory. But this court cannot know what an appropriate conclusion to such an assessment would have been, or what mother Newton might have thought of it. The court is confident, however, without the assistance of expert testimony, that she would not have chosen the discomfort and indignity she suffered on occasion when she was left alone. Although a monetary award for such consequences might well be justified under the law, the novelty of the issues and factual uncertainties caution against it in this case.
Judgment is awarded to defendants, dismissing the claim against them.",1
0019-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Memorandum.
Order affirmed without costs.
In this action, plaintiff sublessor seeks to recover unpaid rent for a co-op apartment for the months of January 2000 through May 2000 from defendant, the subtenant’s guarantor. After learning that the subtenant was harboring two dogs, the co-op served a notice of termination, dated December 28, 1998, which terminated plaintiffs proprietary lease. Thereafter, the subtenant and plaintiff were evicted by the cooperative. However, the lease entered into between plaintiff and the subtenant did not prohibit the harboring of dogs and did not incorporate the proprietary lease provision prohibiting the harboring of pets in the co-op apartment. Accordingly, the subtenant’s harboring of the dogs did not constitute a violation of her lease agreement with plaintiff.
Upon termination of the proprietary lease, the sublease, which was dependent upon the proprietary lease for its existence, likewise terminated (1 Dolan, Rasch’s Landlord and Tenant— Summary Proceedings § 9:62, at 393 [4th ed]; Bruder v Geisler, 47 Misc 370, 371 [App Term 1905]).
Inasmuch as the guaranty signed by the defendant specifically stated that he guaranteed “the full performance of the Lease by the Tenant” and said lease was terminated by virtue of the notice of termination dated December 28, 1998, defendant was not liable for unpaid rent for the months after the termination.
In light of the foregoing, the lower court properly denied plaintiff’s motion to set aside its decision after trial which dismissed his complaint.
Rios, J., dissents and votes to reverse the order and grant plaintiffs motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint in the following memorandum: Plaintiff-appellant subleased his cooperative apartment to defendant Tamara Stern, upon the guarantee of respondent Andor Stern that he would pay “rent and other money charges.” The subtenant failed to pay the $1,200 monthly rental for the period of January 2000 through May 16, 2000. The majority maintains that the cancellation of appellant’s proprietary lease, in December 1999, terminated the sublease and any obligation to pay rent or “use and occupancy.”
While I agree that the cancellation of the overlease invalidates a subordinate tenancy, I disagree that such a termination of the subtenancy relieves the subtenant of the obligation to pay for the use and occupancy of the premises (see Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., 229 AD2d 197 [1997], lv denied 90 NY2d 835 [1997]).
Inasmuch as the respondent herein has conceded that the subject guarantee obligated him to pay for the period of time during which the subtenant remained in possession, I would set aside the dismissal of the complaint and grant plaintiff judgment for five months’ rent less the one-month security held by plaintiff, for a net judgment of $4,800 (665-75 Eleventh Ave. Realty Corp. v Schlanger, 265 AD2d 270 [1999]). Accordingly, I dissent.

0734-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Thomas J. McNamara, J.
Plaintiffs instituted this declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of two provisions of the Election Law. The first provision, Election Law § 8-302 (4), requires a person seeking to vote in a primary election of a political party be enrolled in that political party. The other provision, Election Law § 8-308 (2), prohibits a voter from casting a write-in vote for any person whose name appears on the voting machine as a nominated candidate. The action also raises questions regarding the constitutionality of the content of the voter registration form utilized in this state.
The action was begun in September 2002. Thereafter, an order was issued in accordance with CPLR 1012 (b) directing plaintiffs to provide notice so as to afford the Attorney General the opportunity to intervene in defense of the challenged statutes. Plaintiffs advised the court that notice had previously been provided to the Attorney General and on that basis the order was withdrawn. The parties then agreed, with the consent of the court, to allow the Attorney General until April 2003 to submit a response to the complaint. Pending motions to dismiss by the State Board of Elections and the Republican State Committee were adjourned to that time. Later all matters, including a motion by plaintiffs to disqualify attorneys, were adjourned until June 2003 when motions by plaintiffs for a change of venue, for summary judgment and for leave to supplement the complaint were returnable.
In its submission the Attorney General has moved to intervene and dismiss the complaint. As the matter involves the constitutionality of a statute, the Attorney General may intervene as a matter of right (CPLR 1012). Defendants New York State Board of Elections and New York Republican State Committee have also moved to dismiss the action.
Although the order to show cause, the complaint, the affidavits of the plaintiffs and their memoranda of law are not entirely consistent with respect to the issues and arguments put forth, each raises as an issue the constitutionality of the Election Law provisions noted above. Plaintiffs allege they are registered voters not enrolled in any political party. Each maintains that his efforts to vote in prior primary elections have been rebuffed because he is not enrolled in a political party. Both plaintiffs also contend that they have been unconstitutionally denied the right to cast a vote for an individual by write-in where that person’s name appears on the ballot. Plaintiffs also maintain that the voter registration form does not meet constitutional standards.
Motion to Dismiss (Attorney General)
The motion to dismiss is based on the grounds of res judicata, as to plaintiff Van Allen, standing, as to plaintiff Strunk and failure to state a cause of action.
The assertion that the matter is barred by the doctrine of res judicata is based on a determination of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in an action by Mr. Van Allen and others challenging the constitutionality of Election Law § 8-302 (4). The court affirmed a judgment of the District Court holding that the statute was constitutional based on Rosario v Rockefeller (410 US 752 [1973] [rejecting a constitutional challenge to New York’s closed primary elections]) and Nader v Schaffer (417 F Supp 837 [D Conn 1976] [three judge panel], summarily affd 429 US 989 [1976] [rejecting a constitutional challenge to Connecticut’s closed primary election system]).
Res judicata forecloses a party from relitigating a cause of action which was the subject matter of a former lawsuit (Chisholm-Ryder Co. v Sommer & Sommer, 78 AD2d 143 [1980]). The doctrine operates to bar future litigation between the same parties of a cause of action based on the same transaction (Beck v Eastern Mut. Ins. Co., 295 AD2d 740 [2002]). Although the instant action and the prior federal court proceeding both involve a challenge by Mr. Van Allen, against some of the same defendants, to the constitutionality of the State’s closed primary system, the transaction is not the same. At the time of the federal court action the United States Supreme Court had decided Tashjian v Republican Party (479 US 208 [1986]), holding that the First Amendment protects a political party’s right to invite independents to participate in its primary. However, no recognized New York political party had yet adopted a rule opening its primary to independent voters. Since that time, the Independence Party has adopted a rule inviting those registered to vote without party enrollment to participate in primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for certain public offices. As in Tashjian, there now exists a state party rule which conflicts with a statute requiring party enrollment as a prerequisite to voter participation in a party primary. Based on that change in circumstance, res judicata is not a bar to the instant action.
The motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing as to Mr. Strunk is based on the fact that the enrollment list maintained by the State indicates that he is enrolled in the Independence Party. In an affidavit in opposition to the motion Mr. Strunk maintains that he has never enrolled as a member of the Independence Party and alludes to the possibility that his enrollment status was changed without his consent. This factual dispute, and the underlying motion, can only be resolved upon a hearing.
The Attorney General has also moved to dismiss on the basis that no cause of action is stated with respect to the claims that Election Law § 8-308 and the voter registration form are unconstitutional. Upon a motion to dismiss a complaint for legal insufficiency in a declaratory judgment action, the test is not whether a party will succeed in getting a declaration of rights in accordance with a theory or contention advanced, but whether “[t]he allegations of the complaint . . . when considered as true, demonstrate the existence of a bona fide justiciable controversy which should be settled” (Matter of Schulz v New York State Legislature, 230 AD2d 578 [1997], quoting Sysco Corp. v Town of Hempstead, 133 AD2d 751, 752 [1987]).
Election Law § 8-308 provides:
“1. Ballots voted for any person whose name does not appear on the machine as a nominated or designated candidate for public office or party position are referred to in this article as write-in ballots.
“2. No write-in ballot shall be voted for any person for any office whose name appears on the machine as a nominated or designated candidate for the office or position in question; any write-in ballot so voted shall not be counted.”
Bans on write-in voting are permissible if the State’s ballot access laws are otherwise constitutional (see Burdick v Takushi, 504 US 428 [1992] [upholding Hawaii’s total ban on write-in voting in primary and general elections]), and here, plaintiffs have not attacked the ballot access provisions of the Election Law. Since the unchallenged ballot access provisions are presumptively constitutional, by taking aim only at the limitation on write-in voting, plaintiffs have not raised a bona fide controversy. Accordingly, the attack on Election Law § 8-308 is legally insufficient and that portion of the complaint should be dismissed.
The claims that the voter registration form is unconstitutional should also be dismissed. The deficiencies alleged by plaintiffs are either factually inaccurate (new registrant not afforded a choice as registering as unaffiliated even though box is provided to indicate desire not to enroll in a party), or fail to implicate any constitutional right (e.g., no warning of need to show usual residence). The only exception concerns the statutorily prescribed requirement that the form contain a notice that voting in a primary election requires enrollment in a political party (Election Law § 5-210 [5] [f]). Even assuming that the notice is incorrect, the form itself does not deprive anyone of a constitutional right to vote in a primary. The proper procedure for remedying any deficiency in the content of the form is an article 78 proceeding against the administrative body charged with producing the form (see Matter of Llana v Town of Pittstown, 234 AD2d 881 [1996] [when the challenge is directed not at the substance of the law but at the procedures followed in its enactment, a CPLR article 78 proceeding is appropriate]). Plaintiffs have not brought such a proceeding.
Motion to Dismiss (Board of Elections)
The motion to dismiss by the State Board of Elections is asserted on the basis that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, that there is another action pending for the same relief and for failure to join necessary parties.
The Board contends that because no political party in this state has adopted a rule allowing nonmembers to participate in their primary and given that the State could not force a political party to opt for an open primary, no cause of action is stated with respect to the challenge to Election Law § 8-302. Although the argument was sound when made, as noted, the Independence Party subsequently adopted a rule allowing voters not enrolled in a political party to participate in certain of its primary elections. Consequently, there now exists a “bona fide justiciable controversy which should be settled” (Sysco Corp. v Town of Hempstead, supra at 752).
As to the other motion, the Board contends that plaintiffs are parties to an action in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the voter registration form. As it has already been determined that that portion of the complaint should be dismissed, the motion by the Board to dismiss on the ground that another action is pending is moot. The motion to dismiss for failure to join necessary parties, the county boards of election, should also be denied. The claimed need for their participation is premised on their involvement in voter registration and inasmuch as the portion of the action raising issues regarding the voter registration form is to be dismissed, participation by the county boards is not necessary.
Motion to Dismiss
(New York Republican State Committee)
The Republican State Committee has moved to dismiss the complaint as against it on the basis that no cause of action is stated. It is not clear from the complaint, or the other papers submitted by plaintiffs, why the Republican State Committee, or any of the other political parties, are named as defendants in this action. The desire of a voter not enrolled in a political party to participate in the selection of a party’s candidates is outweighed by the countervailing and legitimate right of the party to determine its own membership qualifications (Tashjian v Republican Party, 479 US 208 [1986]). Thus, plaintiffs, as independent voters, do not have a constitutionally protected right by which they may demand participation in the affairs of a political party. Consequently, no cause of action is stated as to any of the political parties named as defendants.
The Constitutionality of Election Law § 8-302 (4)
Election Law § 8-302 (4) provides in part that “[a]t a primary election, a voter whose registration poll record is in the ledger shall be permitted to vote only in the primary of the party in which such record shows him to be enrolled . . . .” The statute conflicts with the recently adopted amendment to the rules of the Independence Party which allows those enrolled to vote without party enrollment to vote in all primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for certain specified national and statewide offices.
The constitutionality of a state imposed closed primary system has been upheld against a challenge by independent votes in Nader v Schaffer (417 F Supp 837 [1976] [D Conn], summarily affd 429 US 989 [1976]). There, the court found that the statute was reasonably related to Connecticut’s legitimate interest in protecting the associational rights of political party members and did not unnecessarily infringe upon the rights of independent voters to participate in an election. Later, in Tashjian v Republican Party (479 US 208 [1986]), the Supreme Court held that the same statute was unconstitutional. Unlike the situation in Nader, the Court in Tashjian was presented with a challenge by a political party that had adopted a rule inviting registered voters not affiliated with any political party to vote in Republican primaries for federal and statewide offices. Consistent with the concern expressed in Nader for the associational rights of political party members, the Court found that, in the light of the Republican Party rule, the closed primary system impermissibly burdened the constitutionally protected associational rights of the Republican Party and its members.
Here, as in Tashjian, the court is faced with a statute requiring a closed primary and a political party rule inviting independent voters to vote in its primary election. Were this challenge brought by the Independence Party, Tashjian would compel the result that Election Law § 8-302 (4) impermissibly interfered with the constitutionally protected associational rights of the Independence Party and its members. Unlike Tashjian, however, plaintiffs here are independent voters rather than the political party or its members. Consequently, plaintiffs cannot assert the associational rights successfully relied on in Tashjian. Instead they must rely on the constitutionally protected right to participate in a primary election without unwarranted discrimination {see Smith v Allwright, 321 US 649 [1944]).
While the Constitution grants to the states broad power to regulate the time, place, and manner of elections, the grant does not justify, without more, the abridgment of fundamental rights, such as the right to vote or the freedom of political association (Tashjian v Republican Party, 479 US 208, 217 [1986]). The justification for sustaining a closed primary system found in Nader, interference with associational rights, is not present here and, therefore, there is no conflict between the rights of independent voters to participate in the Independence Party primary and the associational rights of Independence Party members. In the absence of such a conflict and because the statute infringes both rights in promoting a closed primary system, any constitutionally permissible justification would apply to a challenge brought to protect either right.
In Tashjian, the Court looked at the administrative burden imposed on the State by the party rule, the State’s interest in preventing raiding, avoiding voter confusion and the State’s interest in protecting the integrity of the two-party system as asserted justifications for requiring a closed primary and determined that each was insufficient to justify the burden imposed. Furthermore, though the Court was free to hypothesize any legislative motivation to discern any conceivable legitimate objective promoted by a closed primary system (see Matter of McGee v Korman, 70 NY2d 225, 231 [1987]), none was noted. Since there is no state interest in conducting a closed primary system sufficient to justify interference with associational rights of a political party opting for an open primary, in the absence of a conflict with those rights, there is no state interest sufficient to justify impingement of an independent voter’s right to vote in a primary to which they have been invited.
In concluding that Election Law § 8-302 (4) unconstitutionally infringes upon plaintiffs’ rights, it is important to make clear the limited reach of the declaration. The prohibition against voting in a party’s primary election unless the voter is enrolled in that party is unconstitutional only insofar as it conflicts with the rule adopted by the Independence Party. The ruling does not require anything more than allowing those registered to vote without party enrollment to participate in primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for the specified public offices. As the Court noted in Tashjian, different circumstances, such as a party seeking to open its primary to all voters or a situation in which independent voters sought to vote in more than one party primary, would raise a different combination of considerations.
Summary
The application by the Attorney General of the State of New York to intervene is granted. The motions by the Attorney General to dismiss on the grounds of res judicata and standing are denied. The motion to dismiss the portion of the action which seeks a declaration that Election Law § 8-304 is unconstitutional is granted on the basis that no cause of action is stated.
The motion by the New York State Board of Elections to dismiss the portion of the action attacking the constitutionality of the New York State voter registration form on the basis that another action is pending is denied as moot. The motion to dismiss the cause of action addressed to Election Law § 8-302 is denied as is the motion to dismiss for failure to join necessary parties.
The motion to dismiss made by the New York Republican State Committee is granted and the action is dismissed as to that defendant and each political party named as a defendant.
The motions by plaintiff to disqualify counsel, to supplement the complaint and for a change of venue are denied. Plaintiffs are granted summary judgment declaring Election Law § 8-302 (4) unconstitutional only insofar as it prohibits those registered to vote without party enrollment to participate in primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for the public offices specified in the amendment to the rules adopted by the Independence Party and filed with the State Board of Elections on February 3, 2003.
. In a closed primary system a voter must be enrolled in a particular political party to vote in that party’s primary election.
. The offices are President and Vice-President of the United States, United States Senator, and Governor and Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller and Attorney General of the State of New York. In Tashjian, the Republican Party of the State of Connecticut had adopted a rule inviting any elector not enrolled as a member of a party to vote in primaries for nomination of candidates for the offices of United States Senator, United States Representative, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Comptroller and Treasurer.
. The amendment to the rules was filed with the State Board of Elections on February 3, 2003. On April 14, 2003 the amendment was precleared by the United States Department of Justice as required by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USC § 1973c, as amended).
. The amendment provides that “[i]n all primary elections to nominate Independence Party candidates for the public offices of President and Vice President of the United States, United States Senator and Governor, Lt. Governor, Comptroller and Attorney General of the State of New York, those eligible to vote shall include enrolled members of the Independence Party and those who are registered to vote without party enrollment.” (Rules of NYS Comm of Independence Party art VI [1].)",0

Michael L. Hanuszczak, J.
In this novel proceeding, petitioner daughter seeks an order from the court compelling respondent father to submit to “blood” (herein referred to as DNA) testing.
The petitioner has resided with her mother from birth, and presently attends a local university where she resides on campus. The respondent appeared before this court in 1989 and admitted to the allegations contained in a paternity petition filed by the petitioner’s mother, whereupon respondent was adjudged to be the father of the petitioner and an order of filiation and support was entered. The petitioner commenced this action contemporaneously with a petition pursuant to article 4 of the Family Court Act filed by her mother and the Department of Social Services (DSS), alleging that the respondent father had violated the order of support. This court confirmed the hearing examiner’s finding of a willful violation of the support order. The respondent owes over $13,000 in accumulated arrears, a portion of which is owed to the Onondaga County DSS. The support arrears and current care payments are currently garnished by the respondent’s employer.
The court finds the order sought by the petitioner atypical in that the respondent father has never denied paternity in court and is making child support payments as well as payment on arrears. The respondent, who appeared before the court telephonically, did not consent to undergo DNA testing nor did he join in the motion to vacate the order of filiation. The petitioner asserts as her basis for DNA testing that the respondent father has denied paternity outside of court to third parties on several occasions. The petitioner claims that DNA test results would provide her with “closure,” and would prevent the respondent from future assertions that the petitioner is not his child. The petitioner’s mother, who was present in court, supports the petitioner’s request.
There are a paucity of decisions whereby adult children request DNA testing of a parent. Such decisions are generally limited to circumstances in which adult children seek to establish paternity posthumously for inheritance purposes. (See generally Matter of Wilkins, 184 Misc 2d 218 [2000].)
The authority to order tests to determine paternity is typically left to the sound discretion of the court. (Matter of Montelone v Antia, 60 AD2d 603 [1977].) Family Court Act § 418 (a) and § 532 (a) also address this issue, “No such test shall be ordered, however, upon a written finding by the court that it is not in the best interests of the child on the basis of res judicata, equitable estoppel, or the presumption of legitimacy of a child born to a married woman . . . (Family Ct Act § 532 [a].) In this case, the petitioner’s mother and father were never married, so the presumption of legitimacy is not applicable.
In proceedings for paternity, custody, visitation, or support, courts have held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel will be applied only where its use furthers the best interests of the child. (Matter of Charles v Charles, 296 AD2d 547 [2002]; Matter of Cleophous P. v Latrice M.R., 299 AD2d 936 [2002].) The doctrine of equitable estoppel is used to protect children from untimely denials or assertions of paternity which might intrude upon an existing, legally recognized parent-child relationship created by marriage or prior order of filiation. (Matter of Sandra S. v Larry W., 175 Misc 2d 122 [1997].) Although in the case at bar the parties have apparently never enjoyed a meaningful parent-child relationship, the respondent did admit paternity in 1989 and has never moved to vacate the adjudication.
The best interests of children are generally served by maintaining their legitimacy. (Hammack v Hammack, 291 AD2d 718 [2002].) In reviewing the circumstances of this matter, it is significant to note that the nexus between the petitioner and respondent has generally consisted of the respondent’s financial obligation to his daughter. Moreover, in this case, where the daughter is an 18-year-old pro se petitioner, the court, in its parens patriae role, must consider the petitioner’s “best interests.” It has been suggested that the doctrine of parens patriae “contemplates not only a right, but also a duty,” on the part of the State to act first for the protection, and then for the best interests of an individual. (Matter of Female S., 111 Misc 2d 313, 315 [1981].) Receiving child support in order to continue one’s education is a basis for such “protection” recognized in numerous decisions. (Cohen v Cohen, 203 AD2d 411 [1994]; Otero v Otero, 222 AD2d 328 [1995].)
Finally, the Court in Montelone held that blood tests should be directed only where the issue of paternity has never been conceded, expressly or implicitly, or actually litigated. (Montelone, 60 AD2d at 603.) The respondent admitted paternity over 13 years ago, and he has never sought to vacate the order of filiation or to otherwise repudiate paternity before the court.
The economic interest of the petitioner daughter is an important concern to the court in view of her current pursuit of higher education. For the foregoing reasons and considering the unusual circumstances present in this case, the court finds that it would be in the petitioner’s best interest to deny her request to compel the respondent to submit to DNA testing.",0
0769-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
John B. Riokdan, S.
This is a motion for an order granting summary judgment. The cross motion is for an order granting discovery.
Before the court is a petition for probate of a will and codicil. A cross petition seeks probate of the will prior to determination of the validity of the codicil and a construction of the will.
The cross petition is brought by Florence Furst, petitioner herein and a beneficiary under the will. Respondents are Bessemer Trust Company, N.A., the nominated executor under the codicil, and the decedent’s three children, Serina Sanchez, Peter Martin and Esmond Martin, Jr. Florence Furst seeks an order granting summary judgment on her cross petition.
The decedent, Esmond Martin, died on June 16, 2002. Bessemer filed a petition for probate of an instrument dated December 16, 1997 and a codicil dated February 17, 2002. The codicil modifies the will by substituting Bessemer as executor and revoking two bequests, exceeding $10 million, to Florence Furst.
Article seventeenth of the will provides:
“If any person or persons named as beneficiaries herein, or benefitting from a power of appointment which I am exercising in this Will, shall file or cause to be filed objections to, or in any manner contest, this Will or any Codicil thereto, in part or in whole, or attempt to prevent the probate thereof, or directly or indirectly institute or prosecute any action or proceeding to invalidate or set aside this Will or any of its provisions, then I direct that such person or persons shall receive nothing under this Will and all provisions for or in favor of such persons or persons, including any exercise by me of a power of appointment in their favor, shall be revoked and I direct that all legacies, devises and other distributions for the benefit of such person or persons shall then be paid and distributed in accordance with the various provisions of this Will as if that person or persons had predeceased me.”
No objections have been filed to the will or codicil. Petitioner seeks a construction of the December 16, 1997 instrument to determine the effect of the in terrorem clause. Respondents contend that whether the petitioner is successful or unsuccessful in a challenge to probate of the codicil, the in terrorem clause will cause a complete forfeiture of her bequests. Petitioner contends that the forfeiture clause is triggered only in the event that she contests the codicil and the codicil is admitted to probate.
Respondents oppose probate of the will prior to a determination of the validity of the codicil. In addition, they oppose construction of the will prior to probate. The general rule is that a construction proceeding must await probate of the will. This rule has been applied to a no contest clause (Matter of Shear, 182 Misc 2d 684 [1999]). There are cases to the contrary (Matter of Grupp, 160 Misc 2d 407 [1994]). The harsh effect of a no contest clause should not be compounded by denying a beneficiary a construction of a will. The beneficiary is entitled to know whether a contest will result in a forfeiture. There being no clear prohibition to a construction prior to probate, the court will determine the effect of the forfeiture clause.
Parenthetically, the court notes that the obligation of Bessemer, as nominated executor to defend the validity of the codicil, should be distinguished from its role in a proceeding to construe the will. In a construction proceeding an executor must be impartial (Isham v New York Assn. for Improving Condition of Poor, 177 NY 218 [1904]). The executor cannot, at the expense of the estate, take a position on behalf of one beneficiary as against another beneficiary.
It is undisputed that an unsuccessful contest of the codicil by Florence Furst will result in a forfeiture of her bequest. The question is whether article seventeenth causes a forfeiture of the bequests if Florence Furst is successful and the codicil is denied probate. In the usual case, one instrument containing a no contest clause is the subject of a probate contest. If the instrument is found to be invalid, the no contest clause will be set aside with the rest of the will (Rollison, Wills § 202 [1939]). Forfeiture always results where the will is admitted to probate (Atkinson, Handbook on the Law of Wills § 82 [2d ed]). In this case, there are two instruments. The validity of the will is unaffected by the defeat of the codicil. Respondents contend, however, that the will and codicil are inseparable and that a challenge to the codicil is a challenge to the will as well.
A codicil is an addition, modification or supplement to an existing will (EPTL 1-2.1). If a will and codicil are validly executed, the codicil republishes the will in whole or in part (EPTL 1-2.1; Matter of Campbell, 170 NY 84 [1902]). A will and codicil are regarded as a single and entire instrument for the purpose of determining testamentary intent (Ward v Ward, 105 NY 68 [1887]; Matter of Moore, 32 Misc 2d 429 [1961]; Matter of Maier, 123 Misc 244 [1924]).
For the purpose of probate, however, a will and codicil are independent instruments (In re Hunt, 122 NYS2d 765 [1953]). A will and codicil are separate instruments in point of execution. One may stand and the other may fall (Osburn v Rochester Safe Deposit Co., 209 NY 54 [1913]).
The no contest clause in this will states that it applies to a contest of future codicils. However, it seems to the court that reason would dictate, that the clause be construed to read “any valid codicils.”
The provision, nonetheless, is ineffective to incorporate by reference a codicil which was not yet in existence. Incorporation by reference requires the existence of an instrument at the time of the execution of the will (Matter of O’Brien, 165 Misc 2d 459 [1995], affd 233 AD2d 561 [1996]). Thus, the no contest clause in the December 16, 1997 instrument applies to the codicil only if the codicil is admitted to probate. Accordingly, if the petitioner is successful in contesting the codicil, the forfeiture clause does not affect her bequests.
As to the construction of the forfeiture clause, petitioner’s motion for summary judgment is granted.
The petitioner seeks a construction of articles second and fourth in the will to determine whether she receives a bequest outright or in trust. Petitioner contends that a construction is necessary to determine her standing to contest probate of the codicil. In the probate proceeding, the court determined that the trustees of the inter vivos trust were the only necessary parties to the probate proceeding and not the trust beneficiaries. While petitioner is not a necessary party in the probate proceeding, she is, nevertheless, an interested party under SCPA 1410 and has standing to contest the probate of the codicil. The petition for an order construing articles second and fourth is held in abeyance pending conclusion of the probate proceeding.
The cross motion for an order granting discovery is held in abeyance with the petition to construe articles second and FOURTH.
The petition for an order granting “partial” probate of the December 16, 1997 instrument, prior to determination of the validity of the codicil, is denied. Presumably, the purpose of the petition was to have the will admitted to probate in order to allow a construction. As the court determined that it would construe the will prior to probate, it is unnecessary to consider this extraordinary relief.
The petition is granted to the extent it requests application of SCPA 315 to this proceeding.
The petitioner’s time to file objections to probate is extended until 10 days after completion of the SCPA 1404 examinations or 10 days after the signing of the decree following this decision.",0

Memorandum.
Judgment of conviction unanimously reversed on the law, plea vacated and matter remanded to the court below for all further proceedings.
On June 20, 2001, defendant was charged with, inter alia, aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the third degree (Vehicle and Traffic Law § 511 [1] [a]). Thereafter, on October 31, 2001, defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine and a conditional discharge. Defendant subsequently moved to vacate his plea pursuant to CPL 220.60 or, in the alternative, vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10. On appeal from the judgment of conviction, defendant contends, inter alia, that his plea was not voluntary and knowing, and his plea allocution was insufficient.
In People v Lopez (71 NY2d 662 [1988]), the Court of Appeals reiterated the rule that, in order to preserve a challenge to the adequacy of a plea allocution for appellate review, a defendant must either move to withdraw his plea prior to sentence, pursuant to CPL 220.60, or move to vacate the judgment in the lower court, pursuant to CPL 440.10. The Court also noted, however, that in “that rare case . . . where the defendant’s recitation of the facts underlying the crime pleaded to clearly casts significant doubt upon the defendant’s guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea . . . the trial court has a duty to inquire further to ensure that defendant’s guilty plea is knowing and voluntary” (Lopez, 71 NY2d at 666). “Where the court fails in this duty and accepts the plea without further inquiry, the defendant may challenge the sufficiency of the allocution on direct appeal” (id.). Upon a review of the record herein, we find that the court below did not meet its obligation of further inquiry under Lopez and, thus, reversal of the judgment of conviction is warranted.
The plea and sentencing transcript reveals that defense counsel informed the court below that some of defendant’s driver’s license suspensions “were in his brother’s name,” after which the court made no further inquiry. Considering the fact that defendant was charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle based on said suspensions, we find that counsel’s incongruous statement clearly required further inquiry by the court inasmuch as it casts a significant doubt upon defendant’s guilt or otherwise calls into question the voluntariness of the plea (see Lopez, 71 NY2d at 666). Moreover, the transcript reveals that defendant only said two words, “No” and “Yes,” during his entire plea. Although the court was not required to make a factual inquiry, the record must demonstrate that defendant’s plea was made knowingly and voluntarily, and the transcript herein fails to indicate the foregoing or that he intentionally relinquished or abandoned any right or privilege (see Johnson v Zerbst, 304 US 458, 464 [1938]; People v Harris, 61 NY2d 9, 17 [1983]), and a waiver cannot be presumed from a silent record (see Carnley v Cochran, 369 US 506, 517; Harris, 61 NY2d at 17). Accordingly, defendant’s plea is vacated, the judgment of conviction is reversed and the matter is remanded to the court below for further proceedings.

Barbara Jaffe, J.
Defendant, charged by misdemeanor information with two counts of third degree assault (Penal Law § 120.00 [1], [2]), criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [2]), and petit larceny (Penal Law § 155.25), moved to dismiss the information pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 30.30 (1) (c) and § 170.30 (1) (e), claiming that the People were not ready for trial within 90 days of the commencement of the criminal action. On August 12, 2003, this court denied defendant’s motion for the following reasons.
June 26, 2002 to July 11, 2002 (excluded):
The official court record reflects that at defendant’s arraignment on June 26, 2002, a felony complaint was filed charging her with one count each of first degree robbery (Penal Law § 160.15 [3]), second degree robbery (Penal Law § 160.10 [1]), third degree assault (Penal Law § 120.00 [1]), and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. (Penal Law § 265.01 [2].) Bail was set and the case was adjourned to July 1, 2002, pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 180.80.
On July 1, 2002, the felony complaint was replaced with a misdemeanor information pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 180.50. Defendant was arraigned, and the People served notice of their intent to present at trial evidence of a largely exculpatory statement made by defendant. (CPL 710.30 [1] [a].) The case was adjourned to the following day to join a felony matter then pending against defendant in Part N. On July 2, 2002, defendant’s bail was reduced to one dollar and the case was adjourned to July 11, 2002 to this part for a possible disposition.
Defendant contends that the five-day period from her arraignment on the felony complaint to the reduction of the complaint to a misdemeanor complaint should be charged to the People. As the People correctly observe, however, this delay is excludable pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 30.30 (5) (c).
Defendant correctly concedes that the delay from July 1 to July 11 is excludable.
July 11, 2002 to February 10, 2003 (43 days included):
It is not disputed, and the official court record reflects, that the following sequence of events occurred:
On July 11, 2002, a motion schedule was set with a return date of September 5, 2002. On August 16, 2002, defendant filed and served an omnibus motion comprising motions to suppress physical evidence and the noticed statement and a demand for discovery and a bill of particulars. On September 5, 2002, the court ordered a Mapp/Huntley/Payton/Dunaway hearing on defendant’s suppression motions, and scheduled the hearing for October 10, 2002. On October 10, the People announced that they were ready to proceed; however, at defendant’s request, the hearing was adjourned to October 31.
On October 31, November 7, and November 20, the People were not ready to proceed. On December 13, 2002, the People were again not ready to proceed. They withdrew the previously served statement notice and also stated on the record that they would not seek to introduce any physical evidence at trial. Defendant, however, did not appear and a warrant was ordered and stayed at counsel’s request. On January 17, 2003, defendant again failed to appear, the warrant issued, and defendant’s bail was forfeited. Defendant voluntarily returned to court on February 10, 2003.
Defendant contends that 56 days, from July 11, 2002, when the motion schedule was set by the court, to September 5, 2002, when the court ordered a suppression hearing on defendant’s motions, should “arguably” be charged to the People because they subsequently withdrew statement notice and announced that they would not be introducing any physical evidence at trial, thereby rendering unnecessary any adjournments relating to the People’s filing of the notice. She more firmly asserts, however, that for the same reason, the People should be charged with 35 days, from September 5 to October 10, 2002, an adjournment granted for the People to prepare for the suppression hearing.
According to defendant, an exclusion of this period of delay would encourage the People to circumvent statutory time limitations by creating a false need for a suppression hearing. Thus, she maintains that, as a policy matter, the People’s withdrawal of statement notice and their decision not to introduce the physical evidence should preclude them from claiming excludable time to prepare for a suppression hearing, especially given defendant’s incarceration during that period. She makes no claim, however, that the People served statement notice solely or in part to circumvent speedy trial limitations.
In support of her argument, defendant cites People v McIntosh (80 NY2d 87, 90 [1992]), where the Court of Appeals observed that the ordinarily excludable delay resulting from the People’s filing of a notice of appeal (see CPL 30.30 [4] [a]) becomes chargeable upon the People’s withdrawal of the notice. In relying on McIntosh, defendant essentially maintains that if the People are to be charged with delay resulting from the pendency of a subsequently withdrawn appeal, then they should also be charged with delay associated with the filing of statement or identification notice which is later withdrawn by the People.
Defendant’s argument presupposes that a meaningful analogy may be drawn between the People’s withdrawal of an appeal and their withdrawal of a notice of intent to introduce evidence served pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 710.30. There are, however, significant differences between the People’s filing of a notice of appeal and their filing of a notice of intent. These differences militate against relying on McIntosh to charge the People as defendant requests.
The taking of an appeal from a trial court’s order suppressing evidence “constitutes a bar to the prosecution of the accusatory instrument . . . unless and until [the] suppression order is reversed upon appeal and vacated.” (CPL 450.50 [2].) In McIntosh, the Court held that where an appeal is withdrawn with the permission of the court, it becomes a “nullity,” and is not “taken” within the meaning of Criminal Procedure Law § 450.50 (2). The Court also observed that “because a withdrawn appeal by the People is a nullity, it cannot serve as the basis for an exclusion from the time within which the People must be ready for trial pursuant to CPL 30.30,” and that “the People’s time to become ready will be deemed to have continued to run notwithstanding the CPL 450.20 (8) appeal if, in fact, that appeal is withdrawn before it is determined.” (McIntosh, 80 NY2d at 90; see People v Ireland, 217 AD2d 971 [4th Dept 1995] [eight months during which appeal was pending until withdrawn chargeable to People].)
By contrast, the filing of a notice of intent to introduce statement or identification evidence at trial does not even toll the running of the speedy trial statute. Rather, it is the litigation prompted by the notice that tolls the statute. (See e.g. People v Green, 90 AD2d 705, 706 [1st Dept 1982], lv denied 58 NY2d 784 [1982] [adjournment following court’s decision on suppression motion excludable].) Litigation does not, however, invariably result from the People’s filing of notice. A defendant may waive motions. Here, for example, where a statement noticed by the People is exculpatory, a defendant could reasonably opt to waive the right to move to suppress it. Thus, a delay in the proceedings for motion practice is not an inevitable consequence of the People’s filing of notice pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 710.30 (1).
Additionally, in deciding whether to appeal a suppression order, the People must determine whether they can go forward without the suppressed evidence. (CPL 450.50 [1] [requiring statement from People asserting that deprivation of use of suppressed evidence has rendered People’s proof either insufficient as a matter of law or so weak that any reasonable possibility of prosecuting charge has been effectively destroyed].) That determination need not be made until after the suppression hearing has been held, and the People have 30 days after being served with a copy of the order appealed from within which to file and serve a notice of appeal. (CPL 460.10 [1] [c].)
With only 15 days from arraignment within which to serve a notice of intent (CPL 710.30 [2], [3] [absent good cause, preclusion of evidence is required upon People’s failure to file notice within 15 days of arraignment on jurisdictionally sufficient accusatory instrument]), the People have little time to decide whether they need to file notice, and they must make that determination early in the life of the case. Thus, a prosecutor may justifiably opt to serve a notice of intent, rather than risk preclusion, where there is a question as to whether notice is required or where the People have not yet decided whether to seek to introduce the evidence.
Although it would be improper for the People to provoke unnecessary litigation by filing a notice of intent where they do not intend to introduce statement or identification evidence, in light of the legislative goal of encouraging early notice (see Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 710.30, at 219; People v Briggs, 38 NY2d 319, 322-323 [1975]; People v O’Doherty, 70 NY2d 479, 488 [1987]), it would be unreasonable to penalize the People for erring on the side of serving notice by charging them with time spent in motion practice which subsequently becomes unnecessary upon their withdrawal of notice. It is also unreasonable to presume that the People would seek to circumvent speedy trial limitations by filing unnecessary notice, as they are usually reluctant to provide the defense with any information before otherwise required to do so.
Given the differences between the People’s filing of an appeal and the filing of a notice of intent and the legislative policy encouraging early notice of intent, defendant’s reliance upon the McIntosh dicta is misplaced. Also misplaced is defendant’s reliance on People v Brown (207 AD2d 556 [2d Dept 1994]), where the Court held that the People were correctly charged with delay occasioned by the pendency of their motion to consolidate defendant’s indictment with that of another defendant, a motion they subsequently withdrew. Those circumstances are more analogous to those presented in McIntosh, as they pertain to the People’s own motion practice.
Defendant also mistakenly relies on People v Williams (186 Misc 2d 47 [Crim Ct, NY County 2000]). There, although the defendant’s case had been adjourned for a suppression hearing, the People withdrew statement notice on the date set for the hearing and were not ready to proceed. Citing People v Green (90 AD2d 705 [1st Dept 1982], lv denied 58 NY2d 784 [1982]), and without any discussion, the court excluded the first adjournment for the suppression hearing, even though the People withdrew statement notice on the very next adjourned date. Once the notice was withdrawn and the People were not ready for trial, the court charged the People with that adjournment, which the People acknowledged was appropriate. (Williams, 186 Misc 2d at 50.) Thus, Williams does not support defendant’s argument.
Here, the People answered ready on October 10 and, presumably, would have gone forward with the suppression hearing that day absent defendant’s request for an adjournment. Thus, there is no reason to infer that the People filed the notice of intent in order to circumvent speedy trial limitations. (Compare e.g. People v Derosier, NYLJ, Oct. 27, 1994, at 29, col 3 [Grim Ct, NY County] [collecting cases where courts held People to shorter trial periods due to improper prosecutorial attempts to circumvent speedy trial limitations].) The court also observes that if the People had withdrawn notice on September 5, when the decision granting the hearing was rendered, and had the case then been adjourned for trial, the People would have been charged with that delay. (See People v Sai, 223 AD2d 439, 440 [1st Dept 1996] [where no hearings ordered on defendant’s suppression motion, adjournment for trial following decision charged to People].)
Finally, defendant’s complaint that her incarceration was needlessly prolonged due to the unnecessary adjournments for the suppression hearing is baseless, as she was actually being held as a result of the matter pending in Part N. She also claims, without any basis, that the exclusion of this delay penalizes her for exercising her constitutional right to move to suppress evidence.
For all of these reasons, this court does not charge the People with delay from September 5, 2002 to October 10, 2002, resulting from the adjournment for the People to prepare for the suppression hearing ordered on the basis of a notice of intent that they subsequently withdrew.
The parties agree that the delays from October 10 to October 31 and from December 13 to February 10 are excludable (CPL 30.30 [4] [b]), and that 43 days from October 31 to December 13, 2002 should be charged to the People.
February 10 to March 11, 2003 (excluded):
Upon defendant’s return on the warrant on February 10, her bail was reinstated and the matter was adjourned to March 11 for trial.
Defendant argues that this 29-day period should be charged to the People, there being no specific statutory exclusion for the period following a defendant’s return on a warrant. Alternatively, she maintains that seven days is a reasonable period of time for the People to prepare for trial upon a defendant’s return on a warrant.
Although it is true that the statute contains no specific exclusion for the period following a defendant’s return on a warrant, the Appellate Division, First Department, has squarely resolved this issue in the People’s favor. (See e.g. People v Roberts, 236 AD2d 233, 233-234 [1st Dept 1997], lv denied 91 NY2d 836 [1997] [delay immediately following defendant’s return on warrant not chargeable to People].) Moreover, the delay is not unreasonable in light of defendant’s two-month absence.
March 11 to May 28, 2003 (23 days included):
The parties agree that the delays from March 11 to April 21, 2003, and from May 14 to May 28, 2003, are excludable and that 23 days, from April 21 to May 14, 2003, should be charged to the People.
Conclusion
Thus, 66 days of chargeable time have elapsed since the filing of the misdemeanor complaint, well within the 90-day statutory limit. Accordingly, defendant’s motion to dismiss is denied. (CPL 170.45, 210.45 [5] [b], [c].)
. “[W]here a criminal action is commenced by the filing of a felony complaint, and thereafter, in the course of the same criminal action either the felony complaint is replaced with or converted to an information, prosecutor’s information or misdemeanor complaint pursuant to article 180 . . . the period applicable for the purposes of subdivision one must be the period applicable to the charges in the new accusatory instrument, calculated from the date of the filing of such new accusatory instrument. . . .”
. Although the People are not statutorily required to notify the defendant of their intent to introduce physical evidence at trial, to the extent that the disclosure requirement of Criminal Procedure Law § 240.20 (1) (f) may also trigger the filing of a motion to suppress, defendant’s argument would logically extend to delay occasioned by an adjournment preceding any kind of hearing, as long as the hearing becomes unnecessary due to action taken by the People.",0
0376-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Herbert Kramer, J.
Plaintiff was crouched on the floor in a well trafficked corridor cleaning a door saddle when he was hit by an unknown man pushing a container filled with debris being carted from a demolition site located elsewhere in the building. Plaintiff moves for summary judgment, claiming that there can be no issue of fact since plaintiff was struck in the rear by a moving object. Defendant opposes asserting that there are questions of fact with respect to contributory negligence and claiming that the motion is premature since discovery has not been completed.
It would seem that being bumped by a cart, hand truck or dolly would be a fairly common experience in our busy world and we would expect to find many decisions in this area. Such, surprisingly, is not the case. There is only one decision in this state and a very few cases across the entire country that deal with this fact pattern. In all but one of these cases, the question of defendant’s negligence was deemed to be one for the trier of fact. The one exception was premised upon the fact that in that case the pusher was unable to see the path ahead of him.
In New York a woman was shopping in a supermarket when she was struck in the back by a shopping cart or a string of shopping carts. The customer did not see what hit her, but said that she observed a string of carts in the vestibule and after the accident an employee who was in the vestibule approached her to see if she was all right. The employee then moved the carts into the store. The employee had little recollection of the events, but said he did inquire to see if the customer was all right and asked if he could get her some help. He said he did not witness the carts strike the plaintiff. The lower court denied defendant’s motion for summary judgment and the appellate court affirmed. (DiFranco v Golub Corp., 241 AD2d 901 [3d Dept 1997].
Moving across the country, in California, a woman was standing near an elevator in the defendant’s store accompanied by her seven-year-old daughter and an infant in a stroller. As she stood there, she felt an impact caused she presumed by a hand truck of some sort that was loaded with cartons. The employee testified that he was pushing the truck from behind, that he could see ahead but not over or under the load; that he stopped to look on either side to see if anyone was there and someone stepped out in front of him and walked toward the elevator. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant and plaintiff appealed. The court held that “[w]hether the conduct of the employee or of plaintiff was negligent was a matter of fact for the jury to decide, and it cannot be said that their implied finding adverse to plaintiff was without evidentiary support or contrary to law.” (Rubenstein v Ohrbach’s Inc., 175 Cal App 2d 630, 633, 346 P2d 429, 430 [1959],)
When we contrast the Rubenstein decision with a decision in Nebraska, we can begin to parse the judicial thinking in this area. (Marple v Sears, Roebuck & Co., 244 Neb 274, 505 NW2d 715 [1993].) In Marple, plaintiff was standing at a counter in the defendant’s store speaking to a clerk when a refrigerator being moved to a stockroom was pushed into him. The trial court directed a verdict on liability and this appeal followed. The person pushing the refrigerator testified that he loaded the refrigerator which was about 6 feet tall and 3V2 feet wide onto a dolly and pushed it down the main aisle of the store. He said “Excuse me” and ultimately proceeded when the people he could see moved out of the way. When he turned into another aisle, he felt resistance and stopped. When he walked around the refrigerator he saw the plaintiff, standing at the counter facing in the opposite direction. Plaintiff said he never saw the refrigerator coming toward him and never heard the clerk saying anything. Plaintiff contended that the facts are undisputed, and established negligence as a matter of law. The court agreed, holding that the pusher’s “vision was so obstructed that he was unable to see [plaintiff] or anyone else behind the refrigerator. [Plaintiff] had no idea of the refrigerator’s approach.” (244 Neb at 278, 505 NW2d at 718.)
The following cases further support the conclusion that unless the facts indisputably demonstrate that the vision of the pusher of the cart or driver was so obstructed as to render that person negligent as a matter of law for proceeding blindly along, the question of liability is invariably one for the trier of fact. In Ybarra v Wassenmiller (206 Neb 164, 291 NW2d 725 [1980]), the plaintiff, a security guard, was injured when a customer, whom he had told to back out of the area, backed his truck into him. Defendant testified that he looked in his rear mirrors and rear window and saw no one — although he admitted that there was a blind spot. The jury returned a verdict for defendant and plaintiff appealed. The Ybarra court held that “Whether the defendant had kept a proper lookout and whether he had the right to believe that the person who told him to move would stay out of the way of danger were questions to be decided by the jury . . . [Although a pedestrian may have a perfect right to be where he is, nevertheless, he is bound to exercise reasonable care for his own safety. The trial court was correct in submitting to the jury the issue of plaintiffs contributory negligence.” (206 Neb at 170-172, 291 NW2d at 729, 729-730.)
In Colorado, a woman had purchased some groceries and was offered the services of a clerk to carry the groceries out. The clerk pushed the shopping cart a few feet behind the plaintiff. Before the plaintiff had reached the next checkout counter, she hesitated to look at a display and the boy ran into her ankle with the cart. The plaintiff sought a directed verdict. The trial judge declined to so rule, and, instead, submitted the question of negligence and contributory negligence to the jury. The jury resolved the issue of liability against the plaintiff. In reversing the lower appellate court and remanding for a new trial, the court held that “[t]he issue is for the jury when the evidence is such that different conclusions might be drawn by fair minded men as to whether negligence is shown.” (Safeway Stores, Inc. v Langdon, 187 Colo 425, 430, 532 P2d 337, 340 [1975].)
A 79-year-old citizen of the District of Columbia went shopping with her daughter and six-year-old grandson in the defendant’s store. They proceeded to the parking lot through a seven-foot-wide passageway, when, at a distance of four feet, a store employee appeared in front of them pushing an 8-to-10-foot-long train of shopping carts at a fast clip. To avoid the carts, the plaintiff stepped aside, stubbed her toe and fell over the curbing injuring herself seriously. The Circuit Court for the District of Columbia held that “If Mrs. Kelley had not attempted to avoid the collision with the shopping carts and had been hit by them, there would have been a clear case for the jury to determine the issue of the store’s negligence in causing the collision. Whether Mrs. Kelley’s fall was caused by physical impact with the shopping carts or by her instinctive and natural movement to avoid the apparently impending collision, the negligence of the store is equally a question for the jury.” (Kelley v Safeway Stores, Inc., 267 F2d 683, 686 [DC Cir 1959].)
Here, as a threshold matter, the defendant’s claim that all of the facts have not been fleshed out through discovery must be reckoned with. Indeed, to decide as a matter of law whether liability must be imposed upon the defendant would in fact require us to know more than we do at the present moment about what the man pushing the cart was able to see. Indeed, if the cart was piled so high with debris that he could not see anyone in front of him, such conduct might well be deemed negligent as a matter of law. However, if his vision was not thus blocked, and, of course, there would be gradations in the amount of visibility that was available to him, then the question for the jury is whether he behaved as a reasonable person would under the circumstances. The jury may well also have to determine whether plaintiffs conduct was reasonable.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is denied with leave to renew after discovery is completed.
. This case is the only New York case, and consequently it is highlighted here. However, the case is not very helpful to us because its primary concern is dearth of direct evidence bearing upon the moment of impact. The Court found the circumstantial evidence to be sufficient and held that “the confluence of the string of shopping carts in the small vestibule, together with the presence of defendant’s employee, raises questions of fact as to whether defendant was negligent in the direction and control of its employees or the maintenance of its store and whether its negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiffs accident.” (Id. at 902.) However obliquely it is saying so, it is also perforce deciding that a defendant who pushes a cart into another is not negligent as a matter of law.
. In commenting upon an assignment of error for the trial court’s refusal to give a res ipsa charge, the Rubenstein court opined: “the jury properly may have concluded from the evidence that any impact was due to a movement of plaintiff into the path of the hand truck which movement was of such a nature and in such a direction that it was not seen or anticipated by defendant’s employee even though he was exercising ordinary care . . . [As to the requested charge:] ‘From the happening of the accident involved in this case, as established by the evidence, there arises an inference that the proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant.’ This would in effect have usurped the function of the jury and constituted a predetermination by the court of an essential question of fact which it was the jury’s right and duty to decide.” (175 Cal App 2d at 635, 346 P2d at 432.)",0
0893-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Thomas D. Nolan, Jr, J.
Plaintiffs, developers of a condominium project on Lake George, sued defendant, Thomas R. Frost, Jr., the project’s architect, and Thomas J. Bien and Associates, Inc., the general contractor, for damages allegedly caused by faulty design and construction. Plaintiffs settled with Bien for $60,000. Plaintiffs and defendant then agreed to submit their dispute to binding arbitration. On July 15, 2003, the arbitrator fixed) plaintiffs’ total damages at $86,620 and apportioned 90% liability against Frost for a faulty roof design and 10% against nonparty Bien for construction defects.
Plaintiffs now move to confirm the award, and. defendant cross-moves to reduce the award to $26,620 to reflect an offset attributable to the $60,000 settlement. Defendant argues that the award violates. New York’s rule prohibiting duplicative recoveries, since, should the award stand, plaintiffs would recover a total of $137,958, i.e., $51,338 more than they were awarded in total damages. \
Arbitration is a favored method of dispute resolution in New York. (Matter of Smith Barney Shearson v Sacharow, 91 NY2d 39, 49 [1997].) Judicial interference with the process and outcome of arbitration is discouraged. (Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v Transport Workers Union of Am., Local 100, AFL-CIO, 99 NY2d 1, 6 [2002].) Unless the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators are not bound by principles of substantive law or by rules of evidence and may “do justice as he [or she] sees it, applying his [or her] own sense of law and equity to the facts as he [or she] finds them to be and making an award reflecting the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement [and an] award will not be vacated even though the court concludes that . . . [the arbitrator] misapplies substantive rules of law, unless it is violative of a strong public policy, or is totally irrational . . . .” (Matter of Silverman [Benmor Coats], 61 NY2d 299, 308 [1984]; accord Matter of New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Assn. v State of New York, 94 NY2d 321, 326-327 [1999].)
The record in this case demonstrates that the arbitrator was keenly aware of the settlement between plaintiffs and Bien. {See report of arbitrator and itemization of award, nn 1, 3, annexed as exhibit B to plaintiffs’ notice of motion.) Moreover, it is clear that although the arbitrator considered the settlement in his deliberations, he chose not to treat it as an offset {see letter of arbitrator, dated Aug. 25, 2003, annexed as exhibit E to defendant’s cross motion).
The issue narrows to whether the arbitrator’s conscious failure to offset the damages awarded by the settlement amount is sufficiently violative of public policy to require vacatur. An “extremely narrow” exception has been established in New York to set aside arbitration awards if public policy is disregarded. (Matter of United Fedn. of Teachers, Local 2, AFT, AFL-CIO v Board of Educ., 1 NY3d 72 [2003], citing Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v Transport Workers Union of Am., Local 100, AFL-CIO, 99 NY2d 1, 9 [2002].) Violations of public policy may take two forms. The first which has no application here is when state law absolutely prohibits the particular matter from being decided in the arbitration. The second is when an arbitrator issues an award which does not follow well-defined constitutional, statutory, or common law of this state.
Defendant’s objection, once again, is premised upon longstanding public policy in this state that litigants are to be fairly compensated but that duplicative recoveries and windfalls should be avoided. (Fisher v Qualico Contr. Corp., 98 NY2d 534, 537 [2002]; Whalen v Kawasaki Motors Corp., 92 NY2d 288, 292 [1998]; Sawtelle v Waddell & Reed, 304 AD2d 103, 116 [1st Dept 2003].) Research has not disclosed a New York decision setting aside an arbitration award on the basis of a duplicative recovery. However, under the Federal Arbitration Act, an arbitrator’s award was modified “[w]hen an arbitration award orders a party to pay damages that have already been paid.” (Eljer Mfg., Inc. v Kowin Dev. Corp., 14 F3d 1250, 1254 [7th Cir 1994], cert denied 512 US 1205 [1994]; Companhia de Navegacao Marítima Netumar v Armada Parcel Serv., Ltd., 2000 WL 60200, 2000 US Dist LEXIS 558 [US Dist Ct, SD NY, Jan, 25, 2000].)
In New York, double recoveries are prohibited and discouraged both in common law (Fisher, supra; Whalen, supra), and by statute (CPLR 4545; General Obligations Law § 15-108). CPLR 4545 codifies the common-law collateral source rule which prohibits recovery of damages for losses which have been replaced or indemnified by certain sources. General Obligations Law § 15-108 requires that a verdict be reduced by the greater of the settlement amount or the settlor’s attributable share of damages. Here, plaintiffs’ claim, if tried before the court, would be subject to a General Obligations Law § 15-108 offset. The arbitrator found defendant negligent, determined the full measure of plaintiffs’ damages, and apportioned those damages between the defendant and the settling tortfeasor Bien, but then did not apply the principles of General Obligations Law § 15-108. Public policy was violated. If the award were jto remain intact, plaintiffs would receive a windfall. The awaprd cannot stand.
Yet, the record in this case does not permit the court itself to modify the award and order an offset of the full $60,000 settlement, since there is an assertion by plaintiff that the settlement made with Bien also encompassed damages plaintiffs sustained by reason of construction defects beyond the roof. Plaintiffs are entitled to the opportunity to prove that some or all of the $60,000 settlement included damages which are unrelated to the roof defects and which should not be set off agpainst the award to plaintiffs.
Remand to the arbitrator to determine what, if any, portion of the $60,000 settlement is attributable to damages unrelated to the roof defects is appropriate. (See Sawtelle v Waddell & Reed, supra at 117.)
Plaintiffs’ motion to confirm the award of $77,958 is denied, without costs.
Defendant’s motion is granted, without costs, and the award is vacated to the extent that the matter is remanded to the arbitrator for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.",0
0062-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Per Curiam.
Judgment of conviction rendered September 11, 2000 reversed, on the law, the facts and as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, and the accusatory instrument is dismissed.
Defendant was convicted, after a nonjury trial, of witness tampering in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 215.10) and aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law § 240.30 [1]), in connection with a single telephone call that he made to the complainant, an attorney and long-time acquaintance. The defendant’s telephone call, made on February 16, 1998 and tape-recorded by the complainant, was prompted by the complainant’s then recent action in reporting to police a series of incidents involving one Polansky, a former girlfriend of both disputants, in which Polansky allegedly made “phony,” “loveydovey” telephone calls to the complainant. The audiotape of the telephone conversation initiated by defendant, which spans just over one minute in duration, reveals that defendant told the complainant that he (defendant) had “two letters written to the grievance committee that [the complainant] used the legal system to harass people” and that defendant “can have [the complainant] arrested” based on “two witnesses that said that [the complainant] assaulted [defendant] in Southampton”; that defendant stated several times that he did not “want to go this way,” and indicated that he was calling as a “courtesy” to try to “work something out”; and that defendant once referred to the complainant dropping the inchoate criminal charges against Polansky (“[I]f you could drop the charges, I don’t have to do that”).
Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the defendant’s initiation of the single telephone call involved here does not constitute fourth degree witness tampering under Penal Law § 215.10. The statute, insofar as relevant, reads as follows: “A person is guilty of tampering with a witness when, knowing that a person is or is about to be called as a witness in an action or proceeding, (a) he wrongfully induces or attempts to induce such person to absent himself from, or otherwise to avoid or seek to avoid appearing or testifying at, such action or proceeding.” (Emphasis added.) As the highlighted portion of the statutory text clearly reflects, Penal Law § 215.10 was intended to proscribe the wrongful interference with or intimidation of a person who is about to or has given testimony in a pending action or criminal proceeding (see Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law § 215.10, at 399; see, by contrast, Penal Law § 215.40 [which makes it unlawful to tamper with physical evidence when it is used or to be used “in an official proceeding or a prospective official proceeding”], § 215.15 [which criminalizes the intimidation of a victim or witness when the actor knows that the victim or witness “possesses information relating to a criminal transaction”]).
So far as is shown in the record now before us, the defendant’s February 16, 1998 telephone call to the complainant was made prior to the commencement of the underlying criminal proceeding initiated against Polansky at the behest of the complainant, viz., on the same day that Polansky was served with an appearance ticket and before the filing of a formal accusatory instrument or Polansky’s arraignment thereon (see, CPL 100.10; People v Weinberg, 34 NY2d 429, 431 [1974]; see also, People v Parris, 79 NY2d 69 [1992]). Notable in this regard is the trial assistant’s record statement during cross-examination of the defendant that at the time defendant telephoned the complainant, Polansky merely had been “issued a ‘summons’ and [had] not [been] put through the system at 100 Centre Street,” and the prosecution’s acknowledgment in its papers opposing defendant’s CPL 330.30 motion below that at the time of the telephone call “defendant knew a proceeding was about to be instituted against . . . Polansky.” (Emphasis added.) Given this chronology, the People failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was either a witness in a criminal proceeding or was about to be called as a witness and, thus, failed to establish that the defendant’s conduct constituted tampering with a witness under the statute as written (see, People v Delgado, 143 AD2d 1033 [1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 854 [1988]; People v Hollenquest, 173 AD2d 560 [1991]; People v Hasan, 185 Misc 2d 301 [2000]). That the witness tampering provisions of Penal Law § 215.10 do not encompass the situation here presented is not only made clear by the plain wording of the statute, but is confirmed as well by the legislative history of the subsequently enacted witness intimidation provisions of Penal Law § 215.15, quoted in People v Delgado (supra, 143 AD2d at 1034-1035):
“Victims are frequently the most valuable asset in prosecution efforts but are not offered assistance under witness protection statutes, including New York State’s tampering statute, because they have not been subpoenaed or have not, at the time of intimidation, acquired witness status in the criminal justice process. Immediately after a crime has been committed is very often the most critical time for intimidation efforts to take place and to be effective. Under the proposed bill, the act of threatening someone not to report their victimization is proscribed and would discourage intimidation during this important period of time” (mem of Paul S. Hudson, Counsel to Crime Victims Bd, to Gerald Grotty, Counsel to Governor, re: 1985 Legis Proposal No. 27, at 13, Bill Jacket, L 1985, ch 667, § 2).
Also infirm is defendant’s conviction of aggravated harassment in the second degree, which was not based on legally sufficient evidence and was, in any event, against the weight of the evidence. The audiotape of the single telephone call underlying defendant’s aggravated harassment conviction establishes beyond cavil that defendant’s exchange with the complainant was spoken in measured tone and was neither denigrating nor abusive in content. At no time during the brief, “courtesy” telephone call — the avowed purpose of which was to “work something out” between former “friends” — did defendant unequivocally threaten the complainant or resort to invective. Defendant’s words, on their face, did no more than haltingly raise the possibility that defendant might pursue available legal channels to address the complainant’s alleged prior misconduct in the event the complainant chose not to “drop the charges” against Polansky, a mutually known third person. Further, it is not unfair to say — and we do not “distort! ] the record” (dissenting op at 69) in saying — that the telephone call now complained of was directed not to an unwilling recipient, but to one who seemingly was all too eager to draw out the conversation in what now appears to have been a studied effort to ensnare the defendant into a trap by capturing the call on a tape recorder surreptitiously used.
In determining whether defendant violated the telephone harassment statute, our task is not to decide whether defendant acted inappropriately in calling the complainant in the emotionally charged circumstances then prevailing or to pass judgment on whether defendant’s statements were indecorous or indiscreet. Rather, the core- issue before us is whether defendant’s isolated telephone call was shown beyond a reasonable doubt to have been actuated by the requisite criminal intent — viz., to “harass, annoy, threaten or alarm” — or to have been initiated in a “manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm” (Penal Law § 240.30 [1]). Based upon a careful review of the record, including irrefutable physical evidence in the form of the tape recording itself, faithful adherence to the review standards governing this appeal (see, People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490 [1987]), and proper application of relevant precedent (see, People v Mangano, 100 NY2d 569 [2003]; People v Taylor, 2002 NY Slip Op 50023[U] [App Term, 1st Dept, Jan. 22, 2002]; People v Livio, 187 Misc 2d 302 [2000]), we answer that question in the negative and hold that defendant’s single telephone call did not rise to the level of aggravated harassment within the meaning of Penal Law § 240.30 (1).
Tried upon an information containing several counts of second degree aggravated harassment based upon allegations, inter alia, that he twice telephoned the complainant on February 16, 1998, defendant ultimately was convicted of the count relating to his initial, tape recorded telephone call and acquitted on the count relating to a subsequent, unrecorded telephone call purportedly made minutes later. In this posture, and “because a trial followed by acquittal is but an accusation successfully met” (People v Cascone, 185 NY 317, 334 [1906]), we find neither record nor legal support for the dissenter’s stated view that defendant’s harassing intent was established by “two telephone conversations accompanied by threats” (dissenting op at 69).",1
0490-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Joseph C. Calabrese, J.
Defendant, Louis Telese, is charged with murder in the second degree.
This case involves the murders of 41-year-old Susan Eigen and her 17-year-old son Richard Eigen on February 26, 1984 in their home at 3412 Ocean Harbor Drive, Oceanside, Nassau County, New York.
Susan Eigen was found partially clothed laying on the floor in the upstairs bedroom hallway outside of the master bedroom, with a belt, bra and bandana wrapped around her neck. She had also been severely beaten about her head and sexually abused. “Ligature strangulation” was determined to be the cause of death.
Seventeen-year-old Richard Eigen was found lying on a step on his back in the master bedroom. Both wrists were tied to a railing with an electric cord and a plastic bag was tied over his head. “Asphyxiation” was found to be the cause of death.
The bedroom appeared to have been ransacked. Dresser drawers were open and the contents of a pocketbook were strewn on the bed.
As a result of the crime scene investigation, two latent fingerprints were recovered, one from a bank receipt found among the items scattered on the bed and the second from the plastic bag used to suffocate Richard Eigen.
Both of the fingerprints were determined to be the thumbprints of the same individual.
Hair was also recovered from the bandana used to strangle Susan Eigen.
Eighteen years later on January 22, 2002 the two latent thumbprints were computer matched to a fingerprint card completed by defendant, Louis J. Telese, in New York in 1988 when he obtained a bus driver’s license.
Louis Telese was ultimately arrested on June 5, 2002.
Defendant moves to suppress postarrest oral and written statements as having been obtained in violation of CPL 60.45. He also moves to suppress postarrest DNA samples on the grounds that these resulted from an arrest not based on probable cause.
He additionally moves to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that 18 years of preindictment delay has violated his due process rights and prejudiced his ability to defend the charges against him.
A hearing was held and the court makes the following findings of fact and reaches the following conclusions of law.
Findings of Fact
1. Preindictment Delay.
Prior to the matching of the latent thumbprints to those of defendant, the People lacked proof to connect defendant to the commission of the murders.
Accordingly, for a period of some 18 years, members of the Nassau County Police Department’s Latent Fingerprint Division compared the latent thumbprint to known prints stored in federal, state, and local computerized fingerprint databases. These checks occurred multiple times each year. Ultimately, on January 22, 2002, the thumbprints were matched to a 1988 fingerprint card containing defendant’s fingerprints.
Clearly, the ultimate matching of the prints resulted from the upgrading of the computerized search systems over this 18-year period. Otherwise, the police exercised due diligence over this time period to match the prints and arrest the alleged murderer.
Defendant offers no proof of actual prejudice to his ability to mount a defense in his case, other than claiming that the People could have matched the fingerprints at an earlier date.
2. Oral/Written Statements.
The evidence at the hearing established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that prior to his being questioned by Detective James McGinn, defendant was read his Miranda rights and knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived such.
Defendant then made various oral statements during the course of being interviewed by Detectives Aponte, McGinn and Graziano. These statements variously appear in the notes of that interview.
Within two. hours of the first interview, Detective Brezski re-interviewed defendant without again giving Miranda warnings. After about 45 minutes, defendant agreed to give a written statement which was written down by Detective Brezski and which defendant ultimately read and signed. The preamble to the written statement contains Miranda warnings which defendant again knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived.
3. DNA Samples.
As evidenced by the written consent form signed by defendant during his initial interview (People’s exhibit 11), he knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily agreed to give hair and saliva samples for the purpose of DNA testing. These samples were taken by Detectives McCarthy and Schiraldi of the Scientific Investigation Bureau.
Conclusions of Law
1. Preindictment Delay.
In People v Almonte (190 Misc 2d 783, 790 [2002]), the court summarized the law regarding postindictment delay, to wit:
“[T]he state due process requirement of a prompt prosecution is broader than its federal counterpart. (See People v Singer, 44 NY2d 241, 253 [1978].) Thus, ‘[i]n a proper case, a lengthy and unjustifiable delay in commencing the prosecution may require dismissal even though no actual prejudice to the defendant is shown.’ (Id. at 253-254 ... see also People v Lesiuk, 81 NY2d 485, 490 [1993].) It is the prosecutor’s burden to establish good cause excusing such a delay. (Singer, 44 NY2d at 254 . . . )
“In balancing the merits of a defendant’s claim of unjustified prosecutorial delay, whether the delay is preindictment or postindictment, the Court of Appeals has identified the following relevant factors: (1) the extent of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the nature of the underlying charges; (4) whether there has been an extended period of pretrial incarceration; and (5) whether there is any indication that the defense has been impaired by reason of the delay. (See People v Taranovich, 37 NY2d 442, 445 . . .) No one factor or combination of factors is dispositive . . . Similarly, the Court ‘has steadfastly refused to set forth a per se period beyond which a criminal prosecution may not be pursued.’ (Id. . . .) The decision is ultimately fact sensitive . . . .” (Some citations omitted.)
Applying these criteria to the facts of the case herein, it is clear that defendant’s due process rights have not been violated and that the delay was justified.
The 18 years which elapsed between the murders and the matching of the thumbprints to defendant were the result of inadequate databases and less than state-of-the-art computers to compare the latent thumbprints to other known fingerprints. Only through the advances in technology was the match finally accomplished giving rise to probable cause to arrest defendant for the crimes.
No crime is more serious than murder and there is no proof at the hearing that the defense has been impaired by the delay. Indeed, the court notes that the People aver in their posthearing memorandum that defendant has filed a notice of alibi wherein it is claimed that several individuals will testify that defendant was with them at the time of the murders.
Defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment as the result of preindictment delay is, in all respects, denied.
2. Oral/Written Statements.
The People have established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statements made in the initial interview were knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made after defendant waived his Miranda rights.
The oral statements to Detective Brezski did not require additional Miranda warnings as defendant was in continuous custody and the questioning was within a reasonable time after the first interview (People v Vasquez, 183 AD2d 864 [1992]).
The written statement was given after defendant had again been given his Miranda rights and knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived such for a second time.
Defendant’s motion to suppress oral and written statements is, in all respects, denied.
3. DNA Samples.
Defendant, who was in custody as the result of an arrest based on probable cause, knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily consented to providing the hair and saliva samples.
Defendant’s motion to suppress the DNA samples is, in all respects, denied.",0

Thomas A. Standee, J.
This matter has come before this court for determination as to whether plaintiff, Gary A. Lewis, is entitled to the patient records of patients of defendants, Peter T. Clement, Thomas G. Gibbs, and Robert E. Parker, III. Plaintiff has already been given the records relating to patients he treated while he was a partner in Westfall Dental Group, LLP. Drs. Clement, Gibbs, and Parker, III allege that Dr. Lewis is only entitled to the records of those patients and that he is not entitled to their respective patient records.
Facts
Dr. Lewis, Dr. Clement, Dr. Gibbs, and Dr. Parker, III worked together in a partnership known as Westfall Dental Group, LLP On January 15, 2003, Dr. Lewis left the partnership to join a different dental group. Thereafter, Drs. Clement, Gibbs, and Parker, III formed a new partnership called Westfall Dental, LLP
Several disputes arose between the parties following Dr. Lewis’ departure from and the dissolution of the partnership. The dispute currently before this court relates to whether Dr. Lewis is entitled to patient records from the patients of Drs. Clement, Gibbs, and Parker, III. Dr. Lewis seeks copies of all patient records reflecting the partnership’s treatment of patients during the partnership’s existence.
Decision
Do Patient Records Belong to the Individual Treating Physician or to the Partnership?
It has been held that a corporate entity that provides medical and dental services has no patients “of its own” and, therefore, no interest in patient records. (United, Calendar Mfg. Corp. v Huang, 94 AD2d 176, 178 [2d Dept 1983].) Rather, “records taken by a doctor in the examination and treatment of a patient become property belonging to the doctor.” (Matter of Culbertson, 57 Misc 2d 391, 392-393 [Sur Ct, Erie County 1968].) Records maintained on a patient are generally comprised of the physician’s “own notes compiled during the course of diagnosis and treatment.” (Id. at 394.)
In light of the above-stated principles, this court determines that patient records are the property of the treating physician or physicians. Therefore, upon dissolution of a partnership, a former partner is only entitled to records of patients with whom a patient-physician relationship was created during the existence of the partnership. A former partner is not entitled to copies of all of the patient records maintained by the partnership, including the patient records of the other partnership members.
Here, Drs. Clement, Gibbs, Parker, III, and Lewis only created patient-physician relationships with those patients that they treated, and as such, are only entitled to those respective patient records. Each of these dentists is entitled to take only the patient records for patients they have treated upon their departure from the partnership. The patient records belong to the treating physician or physicians, not the partnership.
Does the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 Allow the Transfer of the Records?
In their submissions to this court, the parties also argue the applicability of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (42 USC § 1301 et seq.) and regulation 45 CFR part 160. Drs. Clement, Gibbs, and Parker, III proffer that HIPAA prohibits the sharing of files with Dr. Lewis.
HIPAA provides that a party deemed to be a “covered entity” may not use or disclose protected health information except for in treatment, or for payment or health care operations of the individual patient, or to the individual patient, without receiving a proper authorization. A “covered entity” is defined as (1) a health plan, (2) a health care clearinghouse, or (3) a health care provider who transmits any health information in electronic form, as prescribed by the regulation. The parties herein do not dispute that Westfall Dental Group transmitted health information in electronic form and is thus a “covered entity.”
Where the release of patient information and records is for a “healthcare operation,” as defined by the statute, the HIPAA regulations allow the “covered entity” to decide whether or not to release such information. Specifically, 45 CFR 164.506 (c) (4) provides:
“A covered entity may disclose protected health information to another covered entity for health care operations activities of the entity that receives the information, if each entity either has or had a relationship with the individual who is the subject of the protected health information requested, the protected health information pertains to such relationship, and the disclosure is:
“(i) for a purpose listed in paragraph (1) or (2) of the definition of health care operations, or “(ii) for the purpose of health care fraud and abuse detection and compliance.” (Emphasis added.)
Though the language in the HIPAA regulation is permissive in nature, that language cannot supercede another legitimate legal obligation to provide records to a physician who has treated the patient and developed a “relationship with the individual.”
HIPAA cannot be used as a sword or shield in disputes between partners as it relates to the sharing of patient records. If the physician (the covered entity) has a relationship with a patient, the remaining partners may not refuse to provide files by virtue of HIPAA. On the other hand, nothing in HIPAA requires partners to share records with former partners where there is no patient relationship. In other words, a physician-patient relationship is required to trigger the right to patient records and the obligation to provide the patient records.
The patient records in question in this case are patients of Drs. Clement, Gibbs, and Parker, III. Dr. Lewis did not, and does not, claim to have a “relationship” with those patients.
Based on the foregoing Dr. Lewis is only entitled to patient records for patients he treated while a partner of the now dissolved Westfall Dental Group.
. A patient-physician relationship is only created with those patients that a physician actually treats.
. To the extent these records contain financial or other “business data,” all partners of the partnership are entitled to redacted copies of that information.",0
0288-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Jane S. Solomon, J.
Plaintiff Orix Financial Services, Inc. moves to reargue the decision and order which denied its motion, submitted on default, for summary judgment in lieu of complaint. For the reasons below, the motion to reargue is granted, and upon reargument, the original decision and order is vacated, and the motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint is denied, and the action dismissed.
The prior decision, dated February 10, 2003, denied plaintiff s motion and dismissed the action. As relevant here, Orix is a creditor pursuant to a note of a corporation, which defaulted on loan payments, and the defendants are individuals who guaranteed the loan. It appears that Orix is a successor holder of a conditional sales contract for a dump trailer sold by a Kentucky vendor to the corporate obligor Hannco Energy Corporation of Post Office Box 1005, Highway 80, Hindman, Kentucky 41822. It further appears that defendants reside in Kentucky, and have no significant contacts with New York. The loan guarantees provide that Edwin M. Baum, Esq. and C-A Credit Corp., both of New York, are defendants’ attorneys-in-fact and agents to accept service of any process. Orix claims that it served the summons and motion upon C-A Credit Corp. on December 16, 2002, and copies were mailed to defendants at their last known addresses. In the case of defendant Brack F. Baker, the last known address is a Hazard, Kentucky, post-office box used in 1999. Defendant Timothy Fugate also gave a post-office box as his address, although Orix also mailed papers to him at “Highway 80, Hindman[,] Kentucky 41822.”
Discussion
In the February 10 decision, I found that Orix’s proof of service was deficient because the designation of C-A Credit Corp. as defendants’ agent did not comply with the CPLR, and simply mailing the papers to defendants’ last known address is not sufficient.
CPLR 308 provides how service upon a natural person is accomplished. At CPLR 308 (3), service is permitted “by delivering the summons within the state to the agent for service of the person to be served as designated under rule 318, except in matrimonial actions.” CPLR 308 (5) permits service upon a natural person in such manner as the court directs if service is impracticable under section 308 (1), (2) or (4) (which describe permissible methods of service other than upon an agent). CPLR 318 provides as follows:
“A person may be designated by a natural person ... as an agent for service in a writing, executed and acknowledged in the same manner as a deed, with the consent of the agent endorsed thereon. The writing shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the principal to be served resides or has its principal office. The designation shall remain in effect for three years from such filing unless it has been revoked.”
Orix concedes that no defendant designated C-A Credit Corp. as his agent in accordance with CPLR 318. It does not contend that it served the summons and motion by any method under CPLR 308, except to the extent that service upon an agent is authorized under CPLR 308 (3). It argues, however, that the language in CPLR 308 (3) regarding CPLR 318 should be ignored because long-standing legal precedent has, in effect, rendered the nonmatrimonial portion of CPLR 308 (3) a nullity.
Orix primarily relies upon the decision of the United States Supreme Court in National Equip. Rental, Ltd. v Szukhent (375 US 311 [1964]). In that case, the plaintiff brought suit for breach of a lease agreement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against father and son farmers who lived in Michigan. The lease provided that defendants designated Florence Weinberg, of Long Island City, New York, as their agent to accept service of any process within the State of New York. Defendants were unacquainted with Weinberg, who apparently had a relationship with the plaintiff. The plaintiff caused the summons and complaint to be served upon Weinberg, in accordance with the agreement, and she promptly mailed the papers to defendants. Defendants obtained New York counsel, who moved to dismiss the action for want of proper service under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 4 (former [d] [1]) (authorizing service of process upon an agent). The District Court granted the motion, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.
The Supreme Court reversed, finding that proper service was made under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 4 (former [d] [1]), and that such service was not contrary to the policies of New York or Michigan. The Court observed that
“A different case would be presented if Florence Weinberg had not given prompt notice to the respondents, for then the claim might well be made that her failure to do so had operated to invalidate the agency. We hold only that, prompt notice to the respondents having been given, Florence Weinberg was their ‘agent authorized by appointment’ to receive process within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1).” (375 US at 318.)
New York courts have applied the National Rental case in holding that parties to a contract may agree to service upon a third person with respect to litigation arising from the contract, even where that person is not an agent authorized under the Business Corporation Law (such as the Secretary of State) or CPLR 318. (Matter of Board of Educ. of Half Hollow Hills Cent. School Dist. of Huntington [Half Hollow Hills Teachers Assn.], 79 Misc 2d 223, 227 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County 1974].) “Under such circumstances, the requirements of due process are deemed met when the ‘agent’ promptly accepts the summons or process, and promptly transmits it or notice thereof to the principal.” (Id.)
To the extent that the prior decision failed to recognize that service of process upon an agent is permitted under the circumstances described in the above decisions, it was in error, and therefore reargument must be granted. The result in the prior decision nevertheless was correct for the following reasons.
Orix claims that it successfully served defendants under New York law when it served the papers upon C-A Credit Corp. It does not allege that C-A Credit Corp. promptly transmitted to defendants the summons with the motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint, or in any other way put defendants on notice of this action. There is no evidence that C-A Credit Corp. was under any duty to promptly transmit the papers. Accordingly, under the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the National Rental case, C-A Credit Corp.’s failure to give defendants prompt notice may operate to invalidate the agency. The most recent decision relied upon by Orix, Orix Credit Alliance v Fan Sy Prods. (215 AD2d 113 [1st Dept 1995]), found that service on an agent designated in the contract sufficed, but it does not provide underlying facts to support Orix’s position here.
Orix cites no decisions, and the court is aware of none, where service of process is deemed sufficient to satisfy a defendant’s rights to due process when no effort is made to serve the summons on the defendant, and plaintiff does not attempt service specified under the CPLR or seek court approval of service by other means. (CPLR 308 [5].) Indeed, in this case, there is no indication that defendants made any effort to elude service of process, or otherwise are not available to be served by the methods approved by the Legislature.
This discussion accepts Orix’s contention that, by signing the guaranties, defendants agreed to be subject to the jurisdiction of New York State courts, and therefore have purposely established minimum contacts with New York. (Burger King Corp. v Rudzewicz, 471 US 462, 476 [1985].) However, Orix’s method of serving papers upon nonresidents, i.e., by depositing the papers with C-A Credit Corp., with no claim that C-A Credit Corp. sent the material to defendants or was under any duty to do so, does not comport with the traditional notions of “fair play and substantial justice” necessary to establish personal jurisdiction. (Id.) This determination is further supported by the fact that Orix claims that it also mailed the papers, by ordinary mail, to defendants at a post-office box and to a location simply identified as “Highway 80.” On this record, it cannot be said that such service of the summons and motion on defendants is sufficient for this court to exercise personal jurisdiction over them.
Finally, Orix argues that it also mailed the papers to defendants pursuant to CPLR 3215 (g) (3) (i), which requires additional service of the summons and complaint by ordinary mail when a default judgment for nonappearance is sought against a natural person in an action based upon nonpayment of a contractual obligation. This contention is apparently made to suggest that defendants received all the notice to which they are entitled. However, the notice under CPLR 3215 (g) (3) (i) is not a substitute for proper service, but is intended to be an additional notice before default judgment is entered. In this action, Orix does not seek default judgment, but summary judgment in lieu of complaint. In either event, Orix must serve the summons on defendants under CPLR 308, which it did not do.
Accordingly, it hereby is ordered that the motion to reargue is granted, and upon reargument, the decision and order of February 10, 2003 is vacated and replaced with this decision and order; and it further is ordered that the motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint is denied and the action is dismissed.
The CPLR 3215 (g) (3) (i) notice submitted by Orix in support of this motion shows that papers under a different action were mailed to individuals other than the defendants herein. Since this motion is not for default judgment, the error is not material to this decision.",0
0867-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Lucy Billings, J.
Plaintiffs move to modify the court’s decision and judgment dated March 28, 2003. The order awarded defendant Ned Marshall, Inc., the undisputed purchase price and value of an Aubusson rug, $9,450; defendant’s commission of 35% of the purchase price for procuring the rug, $3,307.50; and 'a charge of $117 for shipping the rug: a total of $12,874.50. (Decision and judgment at 30-31 [Mar. 28, 2003].) Plaintiffs now claim defendant Ned Marshall’s testimony that the rug was delivered to plaintiffs, on which the court based its conclusion that defendant corporation was entitled to payment, was perjufed, requiring vacatur of the award. (CPLR 5015 [a] [3].)
I. Prior Proceedings
In their answer, defendants counterclaimed that plaintiffs had “failed ... to make payment in full for .] . . items purchased on Plaintiffs behalf’ (verified answer and counterclaims 1i 14); “refused to pay for . . . furnishings ordered at Plaintiffs’ specific request and purchased by defendant” (id. 1Í 25); and “been unjustly enriched by accepting the ¡benefits of defendant ned marshall, inc.’s work, labor, services and goods without compensating Defendant.” (Id. 1Í 27.) These allegations encompass a claim for the balance owed on merchandise delivered by defendants to plaintiffs and retained b^ them. At trial, defendants specified that these claims included the value of a Chinese Aubusson flat woven rug from Stark Carpet Corporation.
Plaintiffs protest that defendants never articulated a claim for the value of the rug in response to disclosure requests, but fail to point to any requests that called for such disclosure. Plaintiffs’ request for production of documents dated April 26, 2000 simply sought documents related to “services, work, labor and goods allegedly provided by defendants to plaintiffs” (example 3, 1i 2); “demands for payment made by defendants to plaintiffs” (id. H 3); “services, work, labor and goods allegedly provided by any person to defendants or plaintiffs concerning the plaintiffs and their orders for goods and services’’ (id. 11 6); “communications between defendants and other persons concerning the goods and services allegedly ordered by plaintiffs” (id. 1Í 7); “communications with plaintiffs” (id. 1Í 8); and “allegations set forth in the . . . Counterclaims.” (Id. 1i 9.) If defendants’ responses were deficient, plaintiffs’ remedy was, if the deficiency was revealed before trial, to move to compel a complete response or, if the deficiency was not apparent until trial, to move then to preclude evidence of the claim for the rug’s value. In fact, at trial, a document relating to defendants’ claim for the rug’s value was admitted in evidence. (Example 40.) If defendants failed to produce this document in response to plaintiffs’ document request, plaintiffs could have objected to it, but they did not; in fact, they introduced it. (Transcript of proceedings at 76-78 [Mar. 6, 2002].)
At trial, defendant Marshall testified that he selected the rug from Stark Carpet, which delivered the rug to plaintiffs’ home January 31, 2001, on a trial basis, for plaintiffs’ approval, as agreed by the parties. (Transcript at 17-18 [Feb. 21, 2002]; at 79 [Mar. 6, 2002]; decision and judgment at 30.) Plaintiffs neither returned the rug nor made any payment for the rug to defendants or to Stark Carpet, thus assuming control and exercising ownership rights, to the exclusion of defendants’ control of ownership, over property that defendant Ned Marshall, Inc., had procured and was obligated to pay for. (Transcript at 17-18 [Feb. 21, 2002]; at 75-76, 82-83 [Mar. 6, 2002]; decision and judgment at 30; UCC 2-606 [1] [b], [c]; Vigilant Ins. Co. of Am. v Housing Auth. of City of El Paso, Tex., 87 NY2d 36, 44 [1995]; Hunt Co. v S & R Coachworks, 215 AD2d 361, 362 [2d Dept 1995].) Therefore the court held plaintiffs liable to defendant Ned Marshall, Inc., for the price of the rug, defendant’s commission, and the shipping charge: $12,874.50 in total. (Decision and judgment at 30-31.)
Plaintiffs protest further that Marshall’s testimony concerning the rug’s delivery was hearsay, based on his conversations with a Stark Carpet representative, and uncorroborated by documentary evidence or otherwise. Yet at trial, plaintiffs had ample opportunity to object to this testimony, to seek to discredit it, and to offer their own evidence on this issue, but neglected to do so. That opportunity does not extend after the trial has concluded.
II. Plaintiffs’ Current Motion
Nevertheless, plaintiffs now present the evidence they neglected to offer at trial: that Stark Carpet never delivered the Aubusson rug to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs provide no explanation, however, why they did not present this evidence at trial. They do not establish that the evidence was unavailable at the time of the trial or within the 15 days permitted for posttrial motions under CPLR 4404 and could not have been located with due diligence before the trial. (CPLR 5015 [a] [2]; Weinstock v Handler, 251 AD2d 184 [1st Dept 1998]; Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O’Donnell & Weyher v Valsan, Inc., 226 AD2d 102, 103 [1st Dept 1996].) Since this new evidence consists of the testimony of plaintiff Robert Cohen, who was present throughout the trial, and Stark Carpet representative Michael Blechner, plaintiffs surely would have known about or had the opportunity to discover their version of the facts and been able to present this evidence as rebuttal to Marshall’s testimony. (Weinsiock v Handler, 251 AD2d 184 [1998]; see Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O’Donnell & Weyher v Valsan, Inc., 226 AD2d at 103; Gonzalez v Chalpin, 233 AD2d 367, 368 [2d Dept 1996].)
Plaintiffs urge that the testimony of Cohen and Blechner is not just newly discovered evidence that would change the result and therefore be required to have been unavailable ¡previously. (CPLR 5015 [a] [2].) Plaintiffs urge that the testimoriy of Cohen and Blechner establishes that Marshall’s testimony was perjured, thus permitting vacatur under CPLR 5015 (a) (3), for “fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of kn adverse party,” without a requirement that the evidence of perjury have been unavailable previously.
Plaintiffs do not claim a fraud that deprived plainti¡ffs of a full trial. (See Matter of Burgos v Burgos, 304 AD2d 475 [1st Dept 2003].) Plaintiffs had a full opportunity to object to Marshall’s testimony, undermine his credibility through cross-examination, and squarely contradict his testimony through the testimony of plaintiff Nanette Koryn, who testified extensively, Robert Cohen, and Stark Carpet personnel.
Instead, plaintiffs claim conduct that injected fraud into the trial. To claim that any evidence which was not introduced at trial, but which casts doubt on or even squarely contradicts evidence which was introduced and produced the result sought to be vacated, establishes “fraud” under CPLR 5015 (a)! (3) would obliterate any distinction between section 5015 (a) (3) and section 5015 (a) (2) and the requirement under section 5015 (a) (2) that the evidence be newly discovered. Any evidence that is presented in support of vacatur under section 5015 (q) (2) and hence would change the result at trial will inevitably be contradictory to the evidence that supported the original result. Evidence supporting vacatur under section 5015 (a) (2)j, however, unlike the evidence plaintiffs present, must have been unavailable previously.
Plaintiffs may not escape the strictures of CPLR 5015 (a) (2) by selecting the alternative of section 5015 (a) (3). Not all evidence that would support vacatur under section 5015 (a) (2), if newly discovered, including plaintiffs’ evidence, also supports vacatur under CPLR 5015 (a) (3). Vacatur under section 5015 (a) (3) requires conduct intended to defraud. (Burgos v Burgos, 304 AD2d 475 [2003].) Simply revealing evidence that was available but not introduced at the time of trial, but that casts doubt on the credibility of evidence introduced, does not establish the fraudulent conduct contemplated by CPLR 5015 (a) (3).
CPLR 5015 (a) (3), moreover, similarly to section 5015 (a) (2), requires that the fraud not have been discoverable before the judgment. (H & Y Realty Co. v Baron, 193 AD2d 429, 430 [1st Dept 1993].) If plaintiffs had prior actual or constructive notice of defendants’ misleading conduct, plaintiffs may not succeed under section 5015 (a) (3). (Richard B. v Sandra B.B., 209 AD2d 139, 144 [1st Dept 1995]; H & Y Realty Co. v Baron, 193 AD2d at 430; Greenwich Sav. Bank v JAJ Carpet Mart, 126 AD2d 451, 453 [1st Dept 1987]; A. Resnick Textile Co., Inc. v Ramapo Trading Corp., 2003 NY Slip Op 50634[U] [App Term, 1st Dept, Mar. 13, 2003].) Marshall testified about the Aubusson rug on the fourth and fifth days of a 10-day trial that spanned over many weeks. On the fifth day, he identified Michael Blechner as the person at Stark Carpet who provided Marshall with his information about the delivery of the rug to plaintiffs and their failure to return it. (Transcript at 82 [Mar. 6, 2003].) Although plaintiffs had ample opportunity before the trial concluded to rebut Marshall’s testimony through plaintiffs’ subsequent testimony and by contacting Blechner about his version of the facts, plaintiffs elected to forego that opportunity and waited until after the judgment to present their rebuttal. (Richard B. v Sandra B.B., 209 AD2d at 144; H & Y Realty Co. v Baron, 193 AD2d at 430; Greenwich Sav. Bank v JAJ Carpet Mart, 126 AD2d at 453.)
The fact that defendants may have failed to call plaintiffs’ attention to defendants’ claim concerning the rug until the trial is of no consequence. (Jackson v Kessner, 206 AD2d 123, 130 n 1 [1st Dept 1994].) Marshall’s testimony provided plaintiffs “with more than sufficient notice” of defendants’ claim, particularly in view of the length of the trial, giving plaintiffs extensive time to prepare rebuttal to Marshall, the first witness. (Id. at 131.)
Finally, the testimony of Cohen and Blechner does not unequivocally establish that Marshall’s testimony was perjured. Plaintiffs’ belated evidence, untested by potential objections, cross-examination, and rebuttal evidence, is as subject to attack' as defendants’ evidence. Having presented it at trial,! defendants subjected their evidence to potential objections, cross-examination, and rebuttal. Plaintiffs, having failed; to present their evidence at trial, may not escape such attack and then expect their version of the facts to be accepted as the prevailing view merely because it contradicts defendants’ version. Such contradictions are to be resolved at trial. Plaintiffs missed that opportunity. (Richard B. v Sandra B.B., 209 AD2d at 144; H & Y Realty Co. v Baron, 193 AD2d at 430; Greenwich Sav. Bank v JAJ Carpet Mart, 126 AD2d at 453.)
III. Conclusion
For all the above reasons, the court denies plaintiffs’ motion to modify the court’s decision and order dated March 28, 2003 to vacate the $12,874.50 award to defendant Ned Marshall, Inc., for the Aubusson rug. j

Petitioners filed a petition by order to show cause on June 11, 2002, seeking grandparent visitation pursuant to Domestic Relations Law § 72. Respondent moves to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the operative portion of Domestic Relations Law § 72 is unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme Court decision in Troxel v Granville (530 US 57 [2000]) and therefore the petitioner grandparents lack standing to bring the instant petition.
The petitioners are the paternal grandparents of the subject child who was born on September 13, 1990. The father is deceased having died on September 15, 2002. The child resides with the respondent mother. The child’s parents were never married to each other.
Domestic Relations Law § 72 provides in pertinent part that
“Where either or both parents of a minor child, residing within this state, is or are deceased, or where circumstances show that conditions exist which equity would see fit to intervene, a grandparent or the grandparents of such child may apply ... to the family court pursuant to subdivision (b) of section six hundred fifty-one of the family court act; and on the return date thereof, the court, by order, after due notice to the parent . . . may make such directions as the best interest of the child may require, for visitation rights for such grandparent or grandparents in respect to such child.”
The issue of the constitutionality of Domestic Relations Law § 72 has come before the Appellate Division, Second Department, in a slightly different context in the case of Matter of Hertz v Hertz (291 AD2d 91 [2002]). There the Appellate Division reversed a finding by the trial court that the Troxel decision rendered Domestic Relations Law § 72 unconstitutional. Despite that ruling, respondent urges this court to distinguish the instant case and find the statute, as applied, unconstitutional. Respondent’s principal argument is that under the statute when one parent dies both sets of grandparents are given standing to move for visitation. Respondent argues that while it might make sense to give the parents of the deceased standing, it makes no sense to give both sets of grandparents automatic standing. Respondent contends that, as a result, this is the kind of sweepingly broad statute held unconstitutional in Troxel.
While this court disagrees with the assertion that such an interpretation of the statute renders it “sweepingly broad,” the argument raises a more fundamental issue that needs to be addressed and that is the meaning of Troxel. The Supreme Court’s decision in Troxel was accompanied by two separate concurring opinions and three separate dissenting opinions. Some of the discussion among the justices highlight the issue before this court. Before the United States Supreme Court was a Washington state statute which allowed anyone to apply for visitation and set only the best interest of the child as the criteria for determining if visitation should be ordered. The Supreme Court of Washington, that state’s highest court, relying on the Federal Constitution held that the statute unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental rights of parents to raise their child. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Washington Supreme Court, but on narrower grounds “we rest our decision on the sweeping breadth of [the statute] and the application of that broad, unlimited power in this case, we do not consider the primary constitutional question passed on by the Washington Supreme Court — whether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm to the child as a condition precedent to granting visitation.” (Troxel, supra at 73 [emphasis added].) In the majority decision the Court takes note of the proliferation of non-parental visitation statutes throughout the nation and attributes it to the realities of the changing nature of the American family. Moreover, the Court recognized that such statutes are a necessary part of American life. (Troxel, supra at 64.)
In his dissenting opinion (at 81) Justice Stevens observes that the author of the majority decision, “Justice O’Connor would hold that the Washington visitation statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only as applied.” This is undoubtedly correct as Justice O’Connor notes that (at 73) “[w]e do not, and need not, define today the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context . . . the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are at best ‘elaborated with care.’ ” Noting that all 50 states have statutes that provide for grandparent visitation, Justice O’Connor further notes that “we would be hesitant to hold that specific non-parental visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a per se matter.” (Troxel, supra at 73.)
In holding the statute unconstitutional the Washington Supreme Court turned to the state legislature to draft a better statute. In a manner of speaking, the United States Supreme Court turned to the Washington court and noted that it could have found the statute constitutional had it given the statute a narrower interpretation. This is in fact what the Appellate Division, Second Department, did when it held that Domestic Relations Law § 72 can and has been interpreted to accord deference to a parent’s decision, although the statute itself does not require such deference. (Hertz, supra at 94.)
Troxel can be most misleading. It is a case which invalidated a nonparental visitation statute and therefore might seem to undermine the validity of grandparent visitation. However, a careful reading of the case leads to quite the opposite conclusion. The four justices who joined in the majority opinion implied that such a statute could be valid, if validly applied; the three dissenting justices explicitly held that such a statute could be valid and neither dissenting opinion ruled out that possibility. There is every reason to believe that a properly applied non-parental visitation statute would meet with the Supreme Court’s approval. What Troxel clearly does tell us is that to meet constitutional muster a nonparent visitation statute must be applied in a manner that recognizes the presumption that fit parents act in the best interest of their children and that the court must accord some special weight to the parents’ own determination.
Accordingly, this court finds that Domestic Relations Law § 72 properly affords the petitioner grandparents standing to bring a visitation petition. Respondent’s motion is denied.",0
0618-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Matthew F. Cooper, J.
The defendant in this case is charged with petit larceny, in violation of Penal Law § 155.25. On May 28 and 29, 2003, the court held a Huntley/Dunaway hearing. The sole witness at the hearing was Investigator Brian J. Shortall of the New York State Police, who testified on behalf of the prosecution. The prosecution also introduced into evidence a five-page written statement and a one-hour audiotape of the defendant’s interview with Investigator Shortall and other police officers on June 20, 2002. The court finds the testimony of Investigator Shortall to be credible. Based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing, the court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.
Findings of Fact
This case began after Investigator Shortall received a complaint concerning the defendant from a named citizen informant. According to the informant, she was shopping for a house and went to the defendant’s home on May 19, 2002. There, she saw a photo of the defendant in a firefighter’s uniform holding something in his hand, which the defendant told her was a hipbone. The informant further stated that the defendant told her that he had taken many “souvenirs” from the World Trade Center site while working there as a volunteer after September 11, 2001.
On June 19, 2002, Investigator Shortall and Investigator Tracy Andryshak, posing as prospective home buyers, went to the defendant’s residence. While being escorted through the home, the investigators observed a gold-framed photograph of the defendant in the living room. In the photo, the defendant, a retired firefighter, was wearing a firefighter’s uniform and holding a large bone, which the defendant stated was a hipbone he recovered while working as a volunteer at the South Tower of the World Trade Center. During this visit, the defendant also showed the officers two pieces of glass and a radio which he said were taken from the World Trade Center site.
Based on this information, the officers secured and executed a search warrant of the defendant’s home on June 20, 2002. The search warrant was executed by Investigator Shortall and “at least five other people.” Prior to entering the defendant’s home, Investigator Shortall, accompanied by Investigator Larry Wood, approached the defendant and explained why they were there. Investigator Shortall asked the defendant to sign a form consenting to the search of his home “to show that he was voluntarily agreeing to the search,” but the defendant refused. The search party then entered the home and recovered the photograph described above, two pieces of glass, a radio, six employee identification cards and a coin. During the execution of the warrant, which lasted approximately one hour, the defendant remained “alongside” Investigator Shortall.
After the search was completed, Investigator Shortall asked the defendant to come with him and his partner “back to the police barracks.” The defendant asked if he could make a phone call to his wife and he was permitted to do so. The defendant then asked if he could take his own vehicle, but was informed that he would be given a ride back if he needed it. The defendant and Investigator Shortall exited the defendant’s home and walked to the investigator’s vehicle, a black Intrepid, four-door sedan. Investigator Shortall and his partner were both in the front seat of the vehicle, while the defendant sat alone in the rear.
At the police barracks, the defendant was taken to an interview room and asked if he wanted anything to drink. Present with the defendant in the interview room were Investigator Shortall, Investigator Wood and two detectives from the Port Authority Police Department. At the beginning of the interview, which was audiotaped, the defendant was given his Miranda warnings by Investigator Wood. After reading the defendant his Miranda warnings, Investigator Wood asked the defendant if he understood each of the rights explained and the defendant answered “yes.” Investigator Wood then asked the defendant, “Having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to us now?” The defendant responded “yes.” The defendant was then told that Investigator Shortall would conduct the interview. At this point, the tape was turned off to enable Investigator Shortall to set up a laptop computer on which he was going to prepare a typewritten version of the interview.
After the tape was turned back on, Investigator Shortall began the interview by stating that the defendant had indicated that he read and spoke English. He then asked the defendant to read the first Miranda warning aloud and the remaining four rights to himself. Once the defendant was done, Investigator Shortall asked him whether he had been advised of his rights under Miranda, to which the defendant answered “yes.” Investigator Shortall asked the defendant whether he understood those rights and the defendant responded that he was confused about them. The following colloquy then took place:
“investigator shortall: What is it that confuses you about them? Do you need to re-read them or do you need me to explain them to you?
“defendant: I’m not comfortable testifying without an attorney, without knowledge of. . .
“investigator shortall: Hold on. Remember I said I can’t keep up with you.
“defendant: Sorry.
“investigator shortall: Okay. You’re not testifying, what you’re doing is you’re providing a statement, a written statement as to . . . I’m going to ask you questions and the answers are going to be from you, and the questions are going to be specifically on, um, about the stuff that was found at your house as far as conversations you had with me and Investigator Andryshak on June 19. It’s not testimony, it’s a statement. Do you understand that? Do you understand the difference between testimony and statement. Testimony is in court, you go into a court and you testify.
“defendant: It’s the same thing, no?
“investigator shortall: Well, we’re not in a courtroom.
“defendant: Testimony . . . this can be used against me.
“investigator shortall: Absolutely, this can be used against you in a court of law and that’s what that fourth line says.
“investigator shortall: I fully understand ... I have these rights and at this time I agree to waive my rights and make the following statement. Do you agree, do you understand that statement? “defendant: Yes sir.
“investigator shortall: Do you fully understand your rights and at this time agree to speak to me about what happened at your house?
“defendant: Not knowing the implication, I’m not comfortable.
“investigator shortall: Well, I’m asking, do you want to speak to me about what happened at your house and what happened yesterday?
“defendant: Yes sir.
“investigator shortall: Now, I had to type it again ‘cause I can’t keep up. I said do you wish to talk to me today about what happened at your house yesterday and you said yes sir.
“defendant: Yes sir.”
After this exchange, the questioning resumed and the defendant answered questions regarding his statements to the investigators when they visited his home the day before as well as his recovery and removal of items found at the World Trade Center site. The vast majority of the questioning was conducted by Investigator Shortall. There were instances, however, when the defendant was asked questions by either one or both of the detectives from the Port Authority Police Department as well as instances where the defendant was asked questions by two officers simultaneously. At times, the questions were asked in what appeared to be raised voices.
Approximately an hour into the interview, Investigator Short-all, in response to the defendant’s comment that he was at the World Trade Center site to help families, asked the defendant how removing items from the site helped the families. The defendant answered that he was confused by the question. The question was repeated several times and the defendant repeatedly answered that he did not understand the question. At this point, Investigator Shortall told the defendant that he believed the defendant understood the question but did not know how to answer it because there was no appropriate answer. In response, the defendant stated that he did not want to answer any more questions. The investigator then asked the defendant whether he did not want to answer that question or any more questions and the defendant answered “no more questions.” Investigator Shortall concluded the interview and printed out what he had typed on his laptop. Although Investigator Shortall managed to type much of what was said in the interview, the written statement he prepared was in no way a verbatim transcript of the interview.
At the beginning of the document printed out by Investigator . Shortall, which totaled five pages, there was a reproduction of the Miranda warnings as well as a waiver which read “I fully understand these rights, and at this time I agree to give up my rights and make the following statement.” Below the waiver there was a signature line for a witness and for the person waiving his rights. Investigator Shortall signed the witness line and also signed the bottom of each page of the written statement. He then turned the document over to the defendant and asked him to sign the bottom of each page of the document. In response, the defendant told the investigator that he wanted to make a comment on the statement. On the bottom of the first page the defendant wrote “I refused to answer further questions as I feel questioning officer was threatening me with arrest and prosecution if I do not cooperate.” The defendant then signed his name at the bottom of page one. The defendant did not, however, sign the Miranda waiver or the remaining four pages of the document.
The defendant was not formally placed under arrest until the interview was fully concluded. As Investigator Shortall conceded, however, the decision to arrest the defendant had in fact been made prior to executing the search warrant that morning.
Conclusions of Law
The Dunaway Portion
The testimony provided by Investigator Shortall at the hearing clearly established that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. First, there was the complaint from the citizen informant that she had seen a photo of the defendant which the defendant told her was taken at the World Trade Center site along with other “souvenirs” he had taken from the site. (See People v Smith, 124 AD 2d 756 [2d Dept 1986], lv denied 69 NY2d 834 [1987] [information provided by an identified citizen accusing another of a specific crime is sufficient to provide police with probable cause].) Second, there were the observations and information obtained by the officers while posing as home buyers at the defendant’s home which corroborated the informant’s complaint. Finally, there were the items recovered at the defendant’s home pursuant to a valid and properly executed search warrant. (See People v Perez, 266 AD2d 567 [2d Dept 1999] [recovery by police of baseball bat which appeared to be bloody from under a dumpster where defendant was standing plus recovery of a gun and knives established probable cause for defendant’s arrest].)
Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to suppress his statement as the fruit of an unlawful arrest is denied.
The Huntley Portion
It is well settled that a suspect in police custody must be advised of his or her constitutional rights before being subjected to interrogation by the authorities. (Malloy v Hogan, 378 US 1 [1964]; Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 [1966].) The standard for determining whether a person is in custody “is not what the defendant thought, but rather what a reasonable man, innocent of any crime, would have thought had he been in the defendant’s position.” (People v Yukl, 25 NY2d 585, 589 [1969].)
In ascertaining whether a defendant was in custody, courts must take into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter including (1) the amount of time the defendant spent with the police, (2) whether the defendant’s freedom was restricted, physically or otherwise, (3) the location of the interview, (4) the atmosphere of the interview, that is, was there an overwhelming police presence, (5) whether the defendant was cooperative or reluctant, (6) whether the defendant was advised of his constitutional rights, and (7) whether the questioning was investigatory or accusatory in nature. (People v Forbes, 182 AD2d 829 [2d Dept 1992]; see also People v Oates, 104 AD2d 907, 911 [2d Dept 1984]; People v Johnson, 91 AD2d 327, 330 [4th Dept 1983].) Additional factors to be considered are “the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer’s request might be compelled.” (Kaupp v Texas, 538 US 626, —, 123 S Ct 1843, 1846 [2003], quoting United States v Mendenhall, 446 US 544, 554 [1980].) Also of significance to the question of custody is whether the officer would have permitted the defendant to leave and “to the extent that it was conveyed to the suspect, whether the officer knew that a crime had been committed.” (Johnson, 91 AD2d at 330.)
Here, the defendant’s statement was made at the police barracks in the presence of four officers. Although it appears that the defendant cooperated with the police when they asked him to “come down to the police barracks,” it is clear that such cooperation, which occurred after several officers had executed a search warrant on the defendant’s home, was nothing more than “a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority.” (Kaupp v Texas, 538 US at —, 123 S Ct at 1847, quoting Florida v Royer, 460 US 491, 497 [1983].)
Moreover, the tone and nature of the questioning, which lasted for approximately an hour, was at times accusatory and clearly conveyed to the defendant that the officers believed a crime had been committed. Additionally, although not determinative, it appears that the police themselves thought that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position might believe he was in custody and thus they elected to advise the defendant of his Miranda rights twice, one reading right after the other. Moreover, the decision to arrest the defendant had already been made prior to bringing him to the barracks for questioning. Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the instant encounter, one cannot conclude that “a reasonable person in [the defendant’s] situation would have thought he was sitting in the interview room as a matter of choice, free to change his mind and go . . . .” (Kaupp v Texas, 538 US at —, 123 S Ct at 1847.) Accordingly, this court finds that the defendant was in police custody at the time that his statement was taken.
The court now turns to the issue of whether the defendant invoked his right to counsel or his right to remain silent. To cease questioning, a defendant in custody must unequivocally assert his right to remain silent or his right to counsel. (See, e.g., People v Fridman, 71 NY2d 845, 846 [1988] [defendant’s suggestions that he might want to consult with his lawyer found not to be an unequivocal assertion of right to counsel]; People v Hendricks, 90 NY2d 956, 957 [1997] [defendant’s statement “I’ll talk to you but I’m not signing anything else” in response to officer’s post-Miranda request for a written statement was not an unequivocal invocation of his right to silence].) “Whether a particular request is or is not unequivocal is a mixed question of law and fact that must be determined with reference to the circumstances surrounding the request including the defendant’s demeanor, manner of expression and the particular words found to have been used by the defendant.” (People v Glover, 87 NY2d 838, 839 [1995].)
Here, the defendant was administered his Miranda rights twice, once by Investigator Wood and immediately thereafter by Investigator Shortall. In response to the reading by Investigator Wood, the defendant stated, without reservation or hesitation, that he understood each of the rights and that he wished to talk. When Investigator Shortall asked the defendant whether he understood his rights, the defendant replied that he was “confused about it” and that he was “not comfortable testifying without an attorney.”
By their very wording, the defendant’s responses to the questions concerning the understanding of his rights cannot be deemed to have been an unequivocal assertion of his constitutional right to counsel as delineated by the Supreme Court in Miranda v Arizona (384 US 436 [1966]; see McNeil v Wisconsin, 501 US 171 [1991]). The right to counsel guaranteed by Miranda is the “sort of lawyerly assistance” one needs “in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.” (Id. at 178.) In the first response the defendant makes no mention of counsel while in the second he refers to his discomfort at testifying without counsel. Even if one were to consider the defendant’s second response a request for counsel, it was a request for assistance in the context of testifying, which is very different from requesting “lawyerly assistance” in the context of custodial interrogation. And although the defendant may have initially thought that by providing a statement he was doing “the same thing” as testifying, Investigator Shortall promptly explained the difference between the two and advised him that anything he said during the interview could be used against him in a court of law. After the officer’s explanation, the defendant did not request the assistance of an attorney for the interview.
If anything, the defendant’s comments about being “confused” and “not comfortable” were ambiguous or equivocal statements which called for some clarifying questions on the part of the officers. (See Davis v United States, 512 US 452, 461-462 [1994] [in finding that defendant’s statement “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer” was not a request for counsel, Court reasoned that “when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney”].) Here, Investigator Shortall asked the defendant what he was confused about in an effort to insure that the defendant sufficiently understood his rights under Miranda. As our Court of Appeals has stated: “An individual may validly waive Miranda rights so long as the immediate import of those warnings is comprehended regardless of his ignorance of the mechanics by which the fruits of that waiver may be used later in the criminal process.” (People v Williams, 62 NY2d 285, 289 [1984].) Although the defendant in this case may have had questions concerning the process, it cannot be said that he did not comprehend the import of the warnings.
Moreover, the conduct and demeanor of the defendant belie any claim that he unequivocally asserted his right to counsel. Throughout his interactions with the police, the defendant did not have a problem stating his position clearly and unambiguously. When he was asked to sign the consent to search his home, he refused. When he decided, about an hour into the interview, that he did not want to answer any more questions, he said so in no uncertain terms.
Although the defendant expressed some discomfort about speaking at the beginning of the interview, he did not unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent until approximately one hour into the interview. This occurred when Investigator Short-all asked the defendant how he thought he was helping the families by removing items, such as identification cards and photos, from the site. At that point, the defendant stated that he did not wish to answer any more questions and the interrogation ceased. With respect to the defendant’s handwritten notation that he “refused to answer further questions,” the court credits Investigator Shortall’s testimony that the defendant wrote this after the interview had been concluded and after all five pages of the document had been printed out.
Here, the defendant made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights, including his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. He was properly advised of his Miranda rights twice, he indicated that he understood those rights, and at least twice he answered that yes, he wanted to speak to the police. Additionally, the People established that at the time of the statement there was no compelling influence, such as threats, coercion, pressure or trickery, exerted over the defendant. Together these circumstances demonstrate that the defendant exercised a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. (See, e.g., People v Davis, 55 NY2d 731 [1981]; People v Bretts, 111 AD2d 864 [2d Dept 1985].) Furthermore, “[t]hat defendant understood the Miranda warnings administered to him, including his right to remain silent, is evidenced by defendant’s ultimate indication that he no longer wished to talk, at which point the interview was concluded.” (See People v Barrios, 259 AD2d 407, 407 [1st Dept 1999].)
Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to suppress his statement on the grounds that it was taken in violation of his Miranda rights is denied.
. The warnings given to the defendant by Investigator Wood were:
“Sir, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you’re being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you free of charge before any questioning if you wish.
“You may decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer any questions or make any statements.”",0
0608-01,"OPINION OF THE COURT
Gerald Lebovits, J.
Before landlord commenced this nonprimary residence holdover proceeding, landlord served tenant with a combined lease nonrenewal notice and termination of tenancy dated February 19, 2003. The combined notice alleges that tenant is not primarily residing in the subject rent-stabilized premises and notified tenant that landlord does not intend to renew his lease, which was scheduled to expire on May 31, 2003. On April 10, 2003 — 51 days before the lease expired — landlord sent tenant an unsigned renewal lease. Tenant affixed his signature to the renewal lease, designated that he wanted a two-year term, and returned it to landlord on April 15, 2003. Landlord never executed or returned the renewal lease.
Tenant now moves to dismiss the petition, claiming that the renewal lease is valid, even if landlord offered it by mistake. Landlord opposes the motion, alleging that it never meant to renew the lease and that the unsigned renewal lease is not binding. The issue is whether landlord vitiated its nonrenewal notice by offering a renewal lease, thereby waiving its right to pursue this proceeding.
The Rent Stabilization Code requires a landlord to offer a stabilized tenant a renewal lease and permits a landlord not to renew a lease only in specific circumstances. (See 9 NYCRR 2523.5 [a] [covering issuance of rent-stabilized renewal leases]; 9 NYCRR 2524.2 [a] [covering issuance of nonrenewal notices for rent-stabilized premises].) Under the code, a landlord is required to offer a renewal lease within a window period of 90 to 150 days before the current lease expires. (9 NYCRR 2523.5 [a].) If a landlord offers a renewal lease within that period, the code gives the tenant 60 days to sign the lease and return it to the landlord, at which point the lease becomes binding. (Id.) If the landlord does not offer a renewal lease during this time frame, the tenant has the right to a new lease. (9 NYCRR 2523.5 [c] [1].) In narrow situations a landlord may refuse to offer tenant a new lease. (9 NYCRR 2524.4 [a]-[c].) If the circumstances fall into one of these situations, the landlord may issue a nonrenewal notice instead of a renewal lease within the same 90-to-150-day window period before the lease expires. (9 NYCRR 2524.2 [c] [3].)
Tenant’s lease expired on May 31, 2003. Landlord served tenant with a nonrenewal notice on February 24, 2003, within the 90-to-150-day window period. Landlord sent the renewal lease on April 10, 2003, after the window period expired.
A landlord’s intent to create a binding lease is relevant only if the landlord issues a nonrenewal notice within the window period and offers a renewal lease outside the window period. If a landlord issues both a nonrenewal notice and a renewal lease within the window period, the renewal lease always controls, regardless whether the landlord intends to offer a renewal lease. (See e.g. Hakim v Muller, Civ Ct, Hous Part, NY County, Mar. 1, 2002, Schneider, J., Index No. 112162/01, slip op at 2 [holding that renewal lease controls when renewal lease is offered after nonrenewal notice issues and when both are sent within window period], affd 2002 NY Slip Op 50339[U], *2-3 [App Term, 1st Dept 2002, per curiam]; Herman v Meryn, 159 Misc 2d 851, 852-853 [Civ Ct, NY County 1993] [same]; Conthur Dev. Co. v Bartfield, NYLJ, Aug. 10, 1987, at 11, col 1 [Civ Ct, NY County] [dismissing petition because landlord mailed tenant renewal lease less than two weeks after nonrenewal notice, finding that “Unquestionably . . . both notices were timely” sent but that “within a short period of time the tenant received contradictory messages from the landlord”].) If, on the other hand, a landlord offers a renewal lease within the window period and issues a nonrenewal notice after the window period, the nonrenewal notice cannot control — regardless of a landlord’s intent to terminate the lease — because the nonrenewal notice would not have been sent in accordance with the code. (9 NYCRR 2524.2 [c] [3].) Conversely, if a landlord does not issue a nonrenewal notice or a renewal lease during the window period, the code requires that a tenant be given a new lease and provides the tenant with various remedies, without regard to the landlord’s intent. (9 NYCRR 2523.5 [c] [1].) A landlord’s intent to renew a lease is irrelevant in all these permutations.
This court is presented with a different situation from those discussed above: one in which landlord properly sent tenant the nonrenewal notice during the window period but offered tenant a renewal lease after the window period. The code addresses every factual context involving the issuance of renewal leases and nonrenewal notices within or without the window period but the one presented in this case. And the factual pattern raised here was addressed in a published opinion only once before, in Steinmetz v Barnett (155 Misc 2d 98, 99 [Civ Ct, NY County 1992]), in which Civil Court found, implicitly, that a nonrenewal notice is vitiated if it issues during the window period and if a renewal lease is offered after the window period.
Landlord argues that a landlord’s intent to renew a lease is determinative and that it did not intend to renew the lease in question. Tenant argues that once a landlord offers a tenant a renewal lease, a landlord’s intent to renew the lease is irrelevant and that a binding lease is created regardless of the landlord’s intent. Tenant thus argues that a new lease was created despite landlord’s failure to sign the renewal lease, .which is ordinarily evidence of a landlord’s intent not to enter into a lease. But intent is irrelevant only as concerns the window period.
Although both sides cite to many cases to support their respective positions, all the cases, and many like them, are inapposite. Unlike here, in which the renewal lease was offered after the window period, in some cases the leases were sent within the window period. (See Jacreg Realty Corp. v Barnes, App Term, 1st Dept, Aug. 28, 2000, per curiam, Index No. 570988/ 1999, at ii [offering lease within window period], affd 284 AD2d 280, 280 [1st Dept 2001, mem]; Hakim, 2002 NY Slip Op 50339[U], *1; Blecher v Pachay, NYLJ, May 14, 1991, at 25, col 1 [App Term, 2d & 11th Jud Dists, mem] [issuing nonrenewal notice and renewal lease within window period; both parties signed lease; landlord waived right to proceed on nonrenewal notice despite any intent to contrary]; Derderian v Lehmann, 2001 NY Slip Op 40433[U], *2-3 [Civ Ct, Hous Part, NY County] [offering renewal lease and upholding lease despite landlord’s successor-in-interest’s intent and notice not to renew; implicitly suggesting that both renewal lease and nonrenewal notice sent within window period]; Ambassador Realty Co. v Wachtel, 139 Misc 2d 965, 967 [Civ Ct, NY County 1988] [holding nonrenewal notice defective; both renewal lease and nonrenewal notice issued within window period; upholding renewal lease despite landlord’s intent not to renew]; Conthur, NYLJ, Aug. 10, 1987, at 11, col 1 [issuing lease and nonrenewal notice within window period; upholding renewal lease despite landlord’s later attempt to rescind offer]; but see Steinmetz, 155 Misc 2d at 99 [issuing timely nonrenewal notice and offering renewal lease outside window period, but court applied 9 NYCRR 2523.5 (a) beyond window period].)
In other cases, the nonrenewal notice was either sent untimely or not sent at all, unlike the case at bar, in which the nonrenewal notice was sent timely. (See Spirer & Co. v Adams, NYLJ, June 3, 1991, at 27, col 4 [App Term, 1st Dept, per curiam] [offering renewal lease outside window period but not sending nonrenewal notice; renewal lease did not control because of pendency of appeal; landlord offered renewal lease only to comply with code if landlord did not prevail on appeal], revg 144 Misc 2d 903, 910 [Civ Ct, Bronx County 1989]; DeSantis v Randolph, 103 Misc 2d 573, 576 [App Term, 1st Dept 1980, per curiam] [upholding tenant’s right to renewal lease where no valid nonrenewal notice sent and oral lease offer made after window period, despite later action indicating that landlord did not want to renew lease].)
Yet other cases the parties cite are distinguishable on other grounds. (See Ansonia Assoc. v Richter, NYLJ, Oct. 29, 1996, at 26, col 2 [App Term, 1st Dept, per curiam] [involving hotel, which 9 NYCRR 2523.5 (a) exempts from rent stabilization, and landlord’s mistakenly offering renewal lease when no original lease existed]; Coleman v Dabrowski, 163 Misc 2d 763, 764 [App Term, 1st Dept 1994, per curiam] [invalidating mistakenly offered renewal lease sent outside window period because of prior stipulation and consent judgment]; Kibel v Davan Enters., NYLJ, Oct. 31, 1991, at 23, col 2 [App Term, 1st Dept, per curiam] [striking down renewal lease because landlord was required to issue renewal lease by the code, which does not compel landlord to offer renewal lease if tenant violates substantial obligation of tenancy].)
Tenant argues that the renewal lease is binding because landlord offered it after sending him a nonrenewal notice. In effect, tenant argues that by offering the renewal lease, landlord waived its right to proceed on the nonrenewal notice. An automatic waiver occurs if landlord sends a renewal lease within the window period and a nonrenewal notice outside the window period. (See e.g. Hakim, 2002 NY Slip Op 50339[U], *1; Conthur, NYLJ, Aug. 10, 1987, at 11, col 1.) Therefore, if landlord had sent both the renewal lease and the nonrenewal notice within the window period, a waiver would have occurred. The situation is different, however, if a nonrenewal notice is offered during the window period and the renewal lease is sent after the window period.
When a valid nonrenewal notice is sent during the window period and a renewal lease is offered after the window period, proof of a landlord’s intent to reinstate a tenancy must be clear and unmistakable. Waiver is “the voluntary and intentional abandonment of a known right which, but for waiver, would have been enforceable.” (Nassau Trust Co. v Montrose Concrete Prods. Corp., 56 NY2d 175, 184 [1982]; accord Goldman v Becraft, NYLJ, July 13, 2001, at 18, col 2 [App Term, 1st Dept, per curiam].) According to affidavits from Robert Williams, the president of the company that manages petitioner’s building and dozens of other buildings, and Diane Roman, an employee of the managing agent, Ms. Roman mistakenly sent the renewal lease to tenant. That the error was clerical is corroborated by landlord’s not countersigning the lease. Tenant signed the blank lease and returned it to landlord on April 15, 2003, 46 days before tenant’s lease expired. This means that landlord had over a month to consider the lease, execute it, and return it to tenant. Landlord’s decision not to execute it demonstrated its intent not to create a binding, bilateral lease.
To succeed on its claim that landlord waived its right to pursue this proceeding, tenant must show that landlord clearly and unmistakably intended to renew the lease. In some cases a hearing might be necessary to resolve disputed questions of facts and ascertain intent. This is not one of them. Tenant’s only basis to contend that landlord intended to offer a renewal lease is that parts of it are handwritten. But that contention conflates the volitional act of preparing a renewal lease with intending to reinstate a tenancy by vitiating a renewal notice. Landlord evinced an intent not to renew tenant’s lease by sending a timely nonrenewal notice. It manifested no intent to waive the nonrenewal notice and reestablish the tenancy. Had landlord executed the lease, accepted a security deposit, cashed future rent, or sent tenant a letter together with the renewal lease outlining landlord’s intent to reestablish the tenancy, landlord’s intent would have been clear, and landlord would have waived its nonrenewal notice. By issuing a partly handwritten lease unsigned by landlord outside the window period, landlord did not waive the nonrenewal notice.
The goals of the code’s window period are threefold. First, the 90-to-150-day window period gives the tenant a reasonable amount of time — 60 days — to study the renewal lease and return it to the landlord. (9 NYCRR 2523.5 [a].) The time period also gives the landlord a fixed amount of time — 30 days — to sign the lease and return it to the tenant. (Id.) Second, the time period gives a tenant notice that the lease will or will not be renewed. (Golub v Frank, 65 NY2d 900, 901 [1985, mem].) That allows the tenant time to make other living arrangements if the lease is not renewed and assures that the tenant’s rent-stabilized lease will never be revoked at the last minute. Third, if a nonrenewal notice issues, the code provides that tenant will have at least 90 days to challenge the grounds for nonrenewal or find another residence. (9 NYCRR 2524.2 [c] [3].) The reason the code provides that the lease is executed upon its return to the landlord with tenant’s signature within 60 days — even if landlord does not sign the renewal lease — is that landlords are required to renew tenants’ rent-stabilized leases unless the circumstances fit into the code’s exceptions allowing landlords to issue a nonrenewal notice within the window period.
The nonrenewal notice must be sent within the window period or it will never be valid. The code provides a tenant with a right to a renewal lease, absent a valid nonrenewal notice, regardless whether the renewal lease is offered during the window period or whether it is offered at all. (9 NYCRR 2523.5 [c] [1].) If both a nonrenewal notice and a renewal lease issue during the window period, the tenant cannot know which controls. When both are sent within the window period, the tenant is justified in believing that the landlord wants to renew the tenant’s lease. And if the tenant believes that the landlord wants to renew the lease, a danger arises that the tenant will not seek another residence and, were the nonrenewal notice to control, the tenant might become homeless when the lease ends, pending the outcome of a summary holdover proceeding.
Nonrenewal notices must be “clear, unambiguous and unequivocal” (Ellivkroy Realty Corp. v HDP 86 Sponsor Corp., 162 AD2d 238, 238 [1st Dept 1990, mem]) so that tenants receive no mixed messages and know how to protect themselves. Because an underlying principle of the code is to protect tenants (Matter of David v New York City Conciliation & Appeals Bd., 59 NY2d 714, 716 [1983, mem]), courts have chosen to protect the tenant when a nonrenewal notice and a renewal lease both issue within the window period. Courts addressing the matter have implied that if both a nonrenewal notice and a renewal lease issue during the window period, the tenant is entitled to rely on the lease because of the code’s protective policy. (See e.g. Herman, 159 Misc 2d at 853.) But the code does not govern the facts presented in this proceeding. (Cf. Matter of East 56th Plaza v New York City Conciliation & Appeals Bd., 56 NY2d 544, 546 [1982, mem] [finding it “immaterial” that landlord intended not to renew tenancy; code makes proposed lease offers “binding” if they are sent “within the statutory period”].)
If no nonrenewal notice is received during the window period, the tenant’s rights to a renewal lease vest because when the window period ends, the tenant is on notice about what can be expected in the future: that the lease will be renewed. (Golub, 65 NY2d at 901; Chen v Allen, 130 Misc 2d 342, 343 [Civ Ct, NY County 1985].) If the window period expires and the tenant has received only a timely and valid nonrenewal notice, the tenant is effectively on notice that the lease will not be renewed and can have no false expectations.
The courts’ rationale that a renewal lease controls when both a renewal lease and a nonrenewal notice issue within the window period applies only when the renewal lease and the nonrenewal notice coexist within the window period. If a renewal lease is offered after the window period and after a valid nonrenewal notice issues, a tenant is on notice that the lease will not be renewed. Tenants so on notice have no expectation that a lease will be renewed or that they can benefit from the protective provisions of 9 NYCRR 2523.5 (a) and (c) or the courts’ protective policy rationale. Therefore, the validity of the renewal leases must be decided on the basis of General Obligations Law § 5-703 (2), the statute of frauds, which governs transfers of interest in real property.
The facts here differ from those contemplated by the code and common-law authority because the nonrenewal notice was properly sent and the renewal lease was offered after the statutory time window closed. Accordingly, contrary to tenant’s argument, the absence of landlord’s signature on the lease not only matters but is decisive. (See e.g. Blecher, NYLJ, May 14, 1991, at 25, col 1 [upholding validity of renewal lease signed by both parties even though landlord was not required to offer new lease]; River Rd. Assoc. v Orenstein, NYLJ, Dec. 24, 1991, at 25, col 5 [Yonkers City Ct, Westchester County] [holding renewal lease valid despite nonrenewal notice because landlord offered renewal lease without being obliged to do so, because both parties executed renewal lease, and because landlord accepted rent checks for new lease term], affd NYLJ, Dec. 14, 1992, at 32, col 5 [App Term, 9th & 10th Jud Dists, mem]; 320 W. 87th St. Co. v Segol, NYLJ, Feb. 20, 1991, at 27, col 4 [Civ Ct, Hous Part, NY County] [holding that parties create new tenancy if landlord offers and executes a renewal lease despite having no obligation to do so]; cf. Riklin v Schub, NYLJ, July 13, 1983, at 11, col 6 [App Term, 1st Dept, per curiam] [holding “strict letter of statute of frauds” irrelevant when, unlike here, nonrenewal notice is sent after renewal lease is offered and both are sent within window period].)
This proceeding falls outside the purview of the code; hence, the statute of frauds applies. General Obligations Law § 5-703 (2) requires that the party seeking to be bound by a lease exceeding one year prove that the other side signed the lease. (See e.g. Nelson Bagel Bakery Co. v Moshcorn Realty Corp., 289 AD2d 69, 69 [1st Dept 2001, mem]; Otiniano v Magier, 181 AD2d 438, 439 [1st Dept 1992, mem].) Here, tenant demanded a two-year lease. No valid agreement was ever created, given that landlord did not countersign the lease.
Steinmetz is the only published case that covers what happens when a landlord issues a timely nonrenewal notice but then offers a renewal lease after the window period expires. The code only contemplates a lease or a nonrenewal notice sent within the 90-to-150-day window and provides remedies to tenants if a landlord fails to comply with the code. The code does not address what must occur when a nonrenewal notice is properly sent within the window period and a renewal lease is offered after the window period. Yet in concluding that the renewal offer was binding, the Steinmetz court relied on the code and on a Court of Appeals opinion in which the lease was renewed within the window period. (See 155 Misc 2d at 100, citing East 56th Plaza, 56 NY2d at 545.) Moreover, the Steinmetz court never focused on the relevancy of the window period. This court therefore respectfully disagrees with the Steinmetz court’s application of the code.
General Obligations Law § 5-703 (2) provides that a lease longer than a year is binding only if both parties sign it. Both parties did not sign the lease, the lease was for a two-year period, and landlord did not waive its right to bring this proceeding. Landlord neither offered nor created by operation of law a binding, bilateral lease. Tenant’s motion to dismiss is therefore denied.
. Landlord argues that recent appellate authority, in particular Hakim v Muller, holds that a renewal lease offered inadvertently does not vitiate a non-renewal notice. According to landlord, “Hakim v. Muller is distinguishable from the case at bar, since, in that case the lease renewal offer was not issued in error.” (Wagner affirmation in opposition 11 28 [footnote omitted] [emphasis in original].) But because the Appellate Term in Hakim did not articulate whether the landlord contended that it offered the renewal lease in error, this court read the Housing Part file. As Judge Jean Schneider’s decision explains, the landlord in Hakim argued that “its offer to renew the lease was ‘inadvertent.’ ” (Slip op at 2.) Judge Schneider and the Appellate Term squarely decided in Hakim, therefore, that a landlord that erroneously offers a tenant a renewal lease after terminating a tenancy may not proceed with a holdover proceeding based on a nonrenewal notice — so long, Judge Schneider noted, as “a landlord both serves a Notice of Nonrenewal and offers a renewal lease during the same window period.” (Id.)",0
