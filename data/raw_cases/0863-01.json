        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nJoseph C. Teresi, J.\nPetitioner makes this motion to require respondent to produce a copy of the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d and any other internal review conducted and prepared with respect to the death of Kenneth Butler. Respondent opposes the motion. I\nOn October 27, 2002, Butler was arrested and incarcerated at the Rockland County Jail. He died in Nyack Hospital on November 10, 2002. At the time of his death, Butler was an inmate committed to the custody of the Rockland County Jail. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires respondent to conduct a review of the cause and background of the events surrounding the death of jan inmate who dies while in its custody. In the present case, respondent completed such a review which is commonly referred to as a \u201croot cause analysis\u201d and petitioner seeks to obtain a copy of the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d that was completed regarding the circumstances of Butler\u2019s death.\nPetitioner Alan J. Croce serves as Chairman and Commissioner of the New York State Commission of Correction. The Commission of Correction via its Medical Revievf Board is statutorily required pursuant to Correction Law \u00a7 47 (1) (a) to \u201c[^Investigate and review the cause and circumstances surrounding the death of any inmate of a correctional facility.\u201d As a result of Mr. Butler\u2019s death, the Commission initiated such an \u2022 . investigation.\nThe respondent, Anjan Bhattacharyya, is employed as Rock-land County Commissioner of Hospitals and was so employed on November 10, 2002. Respondent\u2019s duties include the oversight of the Rockland County Correctional Health Services, the county agency that provides health services to inmates of the Rockland County Jail. After Mr. Butler\u2019s death, a \u201croot cause analysis\u201d or some type of internal review was conducted and documented regarding the health services provided Mr. Butler at the Rockland County Jail prior to his death and is currently in the possession of the respondent.\nRespondent argues that petitioner\u2019s request should \u00a1be denied because the material requested by petitioner is privileged and confidential, and petitioner\u2019s authority to obtain such documents is at cross-purposes with respondent\u2019s legal obligation to provide adequate medical care to inmates. Respondent believes that if forced to provide petitioner with a copy of the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d relating to Mr. Butler\u2019s death, it will adversely affect respondent (and by extension the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Hospitals) from conducting future \u201croot cause analyses\u201d and internal reviews effectively because of a fear of blame or reprisal. As a result, this will have a significant negative impact on respondent\u2019s ability to improve performance and prevent future deaths of inmates from occurring.\nRespondent also argues that Public Health Law \u00a7 2805-m (1) provides that information required to be collected pursuant to section 2805-j \u201cshall be kept confidential and shall not be released except to the department [of health].\u201d Respondent argues that \u201croot cause analyses\u201d are comprised of information collected pursuant to section 2805-j. Therefore, \u201croot cause analyses\u201d should not be released to any entity other than the Department of Health. Respondent also argues that Education Law \u00a7 6527 (3) excludes disclosure of the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d to petitioner.\nIn the present case, neither party provided this court with case law that was directly on point. This case places the petitioner\u2019s statutory obligation under Correction Law \u00a7 47 in direct conflict with the respondent\u2019s duty to provide adequate health care to inmates. Respondent argues that if it turns over the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d and other internal review material, its ability to meet the needs of inmates in the future would be impaired. This court disagrees and finds that in balancing the equities the greater harm will result from denial of petitioner\u2019s request.\nAfter a full review of the record, this court will grant petitioner\u2019s motion and require respondent to produce a copy of the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d and any other internal review conducted and prepared with respect to the death of Kenneth Butler. Petitioner has a statutory right to examine any and all materials, including the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d under Correction Law \u00a7 47 (1) (a), which empowers petitioner to \u201c[investigate and review the cause and circumstances surrounding the death of any inmate of a correctional facility.\u201d Additionally, Correction Law \u00a7 44 (4) provides that \u201c[t]he chairman may request and receive from any department, division, board, bureau, commission or other agency of the state or any political subdivision thereof or any public authority such assistance, information and data as will enable the commission, the board and the council properly to carry out its functions, powers and duties.\u201d Therefore, petitioner is statutorily entitled to review the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d and other internal review materialj in respondent\u2019s possession.\nThis court considered respondent\u2019s arguments that Public Health Law \u00a7 2801 (1), \u00a7 2805-j (1) (a), and \u00a7 2805-m precluded respondent from turning over the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d to petitioner, but ultimately rejects them, because petitioner has the statutory authority under Correction Law to investigate the death of any inmate of a correctional facility. Additionally, this court considered and also rejected respondent\u2019s argument that Education Law \u00a7 6527 (3) prevented the disclosure of the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d to petitioner. This court finds that petitioner\u2019s statutory duty compels respondent to turn over any and all information relating to Mr. Butler\u2019s death.\nFinally, Correction Law \u00a7 46 (1) sets forth that \u201c|[t]he commission, any member or any employee designated by the commission must be granted access at any and all times to any correctional facility or part thereof and to all books, records, and data pertaining to any correctional facility deemed necessary for carrying out the commission\u2019s functions, powers ajnd duties. The commission, any member or any employee designated by the chairman may require from the officers or employees of a correctional facility any information deemed necessary for the purpose of carrying out the commission\u2019s functions, flowers and duties.\u201d Petitioner has the statutory authority to investigate the death of any inmate in custody and collect any materials that help further its investigation. This court holds that petitioner is legally entitled to the \u201croot cause analysis\u201d currently in respondent\u2019s possession, and respondent must provide petitioner with the complete \u201croot cause analysis\u201d relating to the death of Mr. Butler within 10 days of this decision. The court has considered the respondent\u2019s remaining arguments and finds them to be without merit. I",
