        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMemorandum.\nAppeal from the April 26, 2001 order unanimously dismissed.\nFinal judgment unanimously affirmed without costs.\nOrder dated August 31, 2001 unanimously affirmed without costs.\nThe right of appeal from the intermediate order dated April 26, 2001 terminated with the entry of judgment (Matter of Aho, 39 NY2d 241, 248 [1976]). The issues raised in the appeal from said order are brought up and reviewed on the appeal from the final judgment (CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).\nAn affidavit of service upon a 13 year old alleged to be a person of suitable age and discretion does not trigger the necessity of a traverse hearing on the bare allegation that said 13 year old lacked the necessary discretion. While the adoption of the \u201csuitable age\u201d language in RPAPL 735 implies that \u201cat some point a person should be deemed by the court, as a matter of law, to be too young to have a valid status as deliveree\u201d (Room Additions v Howard, 124 Misc 2d 19 [Civ Ct, Bronx County 1984]), we cannot say that a 13 year old is incapable of accepting service as a matter of law under RPAPL 735 (Chemical Bank v Muller, NYLJ, Aug. 24, 1995, at 28, col 5 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County] [\u201cCourts have routinely held that persons younger than fifteen are of appropriate maturity to accept service\u201d]; Bradian v Chavez, NYLJ, Apr. 23, 1968, at 16, col 6 [Sup Ct, Bronx County] [upholding service on a 13 year old]; Durham Prods. v Sterling Film Portfolio, Ltd., Series A, 537 F Supp 1241, 1244 [1982] [12 year old a person of suitable discretion under CPLR 308 (2)]). Insofar as tenants claim that their daughter was not a person of suitable discretion, the assertions raised in tenants\u2019 supporting affidavit, even if true, did not create a triable issue of the daughter\u2019s capacity for discretion.\nWe also reject tenants\u2019 claim that the court improperly inhibited their attempt to prove that the license agreement, which granted tenants temporary residence in an apartment managed by the Village of Nyack Housing Authority, as an emergency measure and notwithstanding the lengthy waiting list of applicants for housing, resulted from unfair dealing or fraud. The agreement, whose terms were settled after lengthy negotiations between the parties\u2019 counsel, denied tenants no rights under the regulations admitting applicants to permanent housing. The record reveals that tenants were afforded an ample opportunity to prove their claims which the court resolved against them as a matter of credibility. We find no reason to disturb said determinations.\nInasmuch as no issue is raised as to the August 31, 2001 order, we affirm same.\nDoyle, EJ., Rudolph and Skelos, JJ., concur.",
