        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMemorandum.\nJudgment of conviction unanimously modified on the law by reversing defendant\u2019s conviction of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 240.30 [2]) and dismissing that part of the accusatory instrument charging him with said crime; as so modified, affirmed.\nOn appeal, defendant raises issues regarding the sufficiency of the accusatory instrument, insofar as it charged him with aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 240.30 [2]), and the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. A person is guilty of violating Penal Law \u00a7 240.30 (2) when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he or she \u201c[mjakes a telephone call, whether or not a conversation ensues, with no purpose of legitimate communication.\u201d While the Court of Appeals, in People v Casey (95 NY2d 354 [2000]), found that hearsay pleading defects of an information are waivable, it did not dilute the statutory requirement that the allegations of the factual part of the information, and/or any supporting depositions, establish, if true, every element of the offense(s) charged and the defendant\u2019s commission thereof (see CPL 100.40 [1]).\nAn element of Penal Law \u00a7 240.30 (2) is that the telephone call had \u201cno purpose of legitimate communication\u201d (see People v Shack, 86 NY2d 529, 539 [1995]), and the mere recitation, in the accusatory instrument, of defendant\u2019s threat to the complainants does not establish such element. This is so, notwithstanding the fact that a determination that a telephone call had \u201cno purpose of legitimate communication\u201d may involve subjective analysis (see e.g. Shack, 86 NY2d at 538). Accordingly, inasmuch as the failure to allege the foregoing in the accusatory instrument is a nonwaivable jurisdictional defect (see People v Alejandro, 70 NY2d 133, 135-136 [1987]), that part of the judgment convicting defendant of aggravated harassment in the second degree is reversed and the count of the accusatory instrument relating to said charge is dismissed.\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit or are unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05).\nAronin, J.R, Patterson and Golia, JJ, concur.",
