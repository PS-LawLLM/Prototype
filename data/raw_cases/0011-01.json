The corporate defendant (with the individual defendant acting as guarantor) opted to lease a computer software program provided by a supplier of its own choosing. As a result, defendants were obligated to honor the terms of the lease agreement with plaintiff irrespective of any difficulties with the program or its supplier. Inasmuch as it is uncontroverted that defendants failed to make the required payment, plaintiff is entitled to recover the damages as set forth in the finance lease (see generally UCC 2-A-103 [1] [g]; 2-A-209, 2-A-407; see also General Elec. Capital Corp. v National Tractor Trailer School, 175 Misc 2d 20 [1997]).\nPesce, EJ., Aronin and Golia, JJ., concur.",
