        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nThomas A. Standee, J.\nPetitioner, Gordon E. Fresher, Jr., has moved by order to show cause for an order granting the following relief: (1) requiring ORMEC Systems Corp. (OSC) to permit petitioner and/or designated agents to inspect and make extracts from the records of shareholders of OSC pursuant to Business Corporation Law \u00a7 624; (2) an order of injunction prohibiting respondent Krasnicki from acquiring and/or offering to acquire shares of common stock of ORMEC from shareholders without first complying with the requirements of Business Corporation Law article 16, the Security Takeover Disclosure Act; and (3) requiring respondent Krasnicki to pay petitioner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with this petition.\nThe order to show cause also contained a temporary restraining order prohibiting OSC from issuing treasury stock to respondent Krasnicki.\nFacts\nPetitioner is the former CEO and president of OSC. Petitioner was removed from the offices of CEO and chairman of the board by the Board of Directors of OSC in March 2001. By September of 2002, petitioner resigned his director\u2019s position on the board.\nPetitioner alleges that there was \u201cconsiderable friction\u201d between himself and the board for at least a year prior to his termination. On or about May 2002, petitioner allegedly threatened litigation against OSC. A settlement agreement and release were negotiated by petitioner and OSC, addressing the issues arising out of petitioner\u2019s employment.\nIn October of 2002, respondent Krasnicki joined OSC as president and CEO, and he was also elected to the board at that time. When respondent Krasnicki joined OSC, the board expressed a desire to hire someone with the required demonstrated performance background, as well as an individual who would be willing to invest in OSC in a significant way.\nAt a December 10, 2002 shareholders\u2019 meeting, the owners of a majority of the shares voted to authorize Krasnicki\u2019s right to purchase 20% of OSC\u2019s stock from the corporation or from OSC shareholders at the price of $1.10, the stock price determined by the board. On March 31, 2003, Krasnicki purchased 372,576 shares of OSC stock directly from the corporation, representing 20% of the outstanding shares of OSC stock.\nOn December 4, 2002, petitioner issued a request to view OSC\u2019s current shareholder list. That list was thereafter furnished to petitioner, upon petitioner\u2019s execution of a statement, pursuant to Business Corporation Law \u00a7 624, stating that he would only use the information in the best interests of OSC.\nOn February 18, 2003, Krasnicki sent a letter to OSC\u2019s shareholders, outlining the terms of his purchase of OSC\u2019s stock. Shortly thereafter, petitioner sent a letter to OSC\u2019s shareholders, indicating that he was aware of a bid from an outside party for the purchase of OSC\u2019s shares.\nBeginning in March 2003, petitioner again requested OSC\u2019s list of shareholders on three separate occasions: March 20, 2003, March 27, 2003, and April 9, 2003. Petitioner\u2019s requests were denied by OSC, which alleged that petitioner had been in contact with a competitor, was aware of a bid for the purchase of OSC\u2019s stock, and that petitioner used that information contrary to OSC\u2019s best interests.\nDecision\nApplicability of Business Corporation Law Article 16\nArticle 16 of the Business Corporation Law, entitled the \u201cSecurity Takeover Disclosure Act,\u201d governs takeover bids of domestic corporations. Section 1601 (a) of the Business Corporation Law defines \u201ctakeover bids\u201d as follows:\n\u201c(a) \u2018Takeover bids\u2019 means the acquisition of or offer to acquire by an offeror from an offeree, pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, any equity security of a target company, if after acquisition thereof the offeror would, directly or indirectly, be a beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of the issued and outstanding equity securities of a target company.\u201d (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 1601 [a].)\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary also provides a definition of \u201cTakeover bid\u201d:\n\u201cAn attempt by an outside corporation or group, usually called the aggressor or \u2018insurgent,\u2019 to wrest control away from incumbent management of target corporation. A takeover bid may involve purchase of shares, a tender offer, a sale of assets or a proposal that the target merge voluntarily into the aggressor.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1454 [6th ed 1990].)\nPetitioner argues that the transaction at issue herein is governed by article 16, despite the fact that respondents allege that the purchase of shares was authorized by Business Corporation Law \u00a7 505 (d). Section 505 (d) states:\n\u201cThe issue of such rights or options to one or more directors, officers, or employees of the corporation ... as an incentive to service or continued service with the corporation . . . shall be authorized . . . by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders entitled to vote thereon . . . .\u201d (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 505 [d].)\nPetitioner alleges that although section 505 (d) of the Business Corporation Law authorizes directors and officers to purchase shares of treasury stock, it does not exempt the transaction from the provision of article 16 of the Business Corporation Law. Petitioner alleges that article 16 is broad in scope and does not exclude acquisitions of stock authorized elsewhere in the Business Corporation Law.\nDespite petitioner\u2019s contentions, it is this court\u2019s determination that Business Corporation Law \u00a7 505 (d) does not require compliance with Business Corporation Law article 16. The evidence before this court reveals that respondent Krasnicki\u2019s purchase of the subject shares arose from his employment relationship with OSC, and not as a result of a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders. Petitioner provides no authority to the contrary.\nRespondent Krasnicki joined OSC as president and CEO in October 2002. On December 10, 2002, 80% of the shares of OSC\u2019s then outstanding stock were voted to authorize Krasnicki to purchase 20% of OSC\u2019s stock either directly from the corporation or from OSC\u2019s shareholders. On March 31, 2003, Krasnicki purchased 372,576 shares of newly issued treasury stock directly from OSC. The consideration Krasnicki paid for this stock was set by the board of directors pursuant to Business Corporation Law \u00a7 504 (a).\nKrasnicki\u2019s purchase of the subject shares conformed with the requirements of Business Corporation Law \u00a7 505 (d), and that transaction was approved by a majority of the shareholders. Despite petitioner\u2019s contentions, there is no evidence before this court that respondent Krasnicki acquired the stock pursuant to a \u201ctender offer,\u201d as that term is used in article 16 of the Business Corporation Law.\nLikewise, respondent Krasnicki was not making a \u201ctakeover bid.\u201d The evidence before this court does not indicate that respondent Krasnicki was an \u201coutsider\u201d who was attempting \u201cto wrest control away from incumbent management.\u201d (See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1454.) Rather, the evidence demonstrates that respondent Krasnicki was hired to cooperate with OSC due to both his demonstrated performance background, as well as his willingness to invest in OSC.\nPetitioner\u2019s motion for an order of injunction prohibiting respondent Krasnicki from acquiring and/or offering to acquire shares of common stock of OSC without first complying with Business Corporation Law article 16 is denied.\nThe temporary restraining order prohibiting OSC from issuing its treasury stock to respondent Krasnicki is vacated. Petitioner\u2019s Request for OSC\u2019s Shareholder Information\nA shareholder\u2019s right to inspect the books and records of a corporation is conditioned upon the shareholder\u2019s good faith. (Matter of RDR Assoc., 63 AD2d 888, 889 [1st Dept 1978]; Matter of Wolberg v Wolberg Elec. Supply, 72 AD2d 903 [3d Dept 1979].)\n\u201cImproper purposes are those which are inimical to the corporation, for example, to discover business secrets to aid a competitor of the corporation, to secure prospects for personal business, to find technical defects in corporate transactions to institute \u2018strike suits\u2019, and to locate information to pursue one\u2019s own social or political goals.\u201d (Matter of Tatko v Tatko Bros. Slate Co., 173 AD2d 917, 917-918 [3d Dept 1991].)\nHere, petitioner was removed from his position as OSC\u2019s president and CEO in 2001 and was terminated from his employment with OSC in May 2002. The evidence provided to this court by the parties indicates that petitioner has characterized his relationship with OSC as \u201ccontentious\u201d and that petitioner has allegedly expressed a desire, during the May 14, 2002 board of directors meeting, to \u201ctake the company down.\u201d (See exhibit A to surreply of Edward J. Krasnicki, dated June 4, 2003.)\nRespondents have raised a question as to whether petitioner\u2019s request for information pursuant to Business Corporation Law \u00a7 624 is motivated by bad faith and/or improper motives. This court will schedule a hearing on the issue of good faith at a conference that will be set by chambers after an order on these motions is received and signed.\nPetitioner\u2019s motion to require OSC to permit petitioner and/or designated agents to inspect and make extracts from the records of shareholders of OSC pursuant to Business Corporation Law \u00a7 624 is denied without prejudice until a hearing on the issue of good faith is conducted. Petitioner\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees is also denied without prejudice pending the hearing.",
