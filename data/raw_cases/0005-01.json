        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMemorandum.\nJudgment of conviction unanimously affirmed.\nDefendant\u2019s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence is unpreserved for appellate review (see CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620 [1983]), we find that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, with respect to defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence does not support a finding of \u201cintent to use unlawfully against another,\u201d it is well settled that intent may be inferred from the act itself, or \u201cfrom the defendant\u2019s conduct or the surrounding circumstances\u201d (People v Bracey, 41 NY2d 296, 301 [internal quotation marks omitted]).\nWith respect to defendant\u2019s argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, it is noted that resolution of issues of credibility, as well as the weight to be accorded to the evidence presented, are primarily questions to be determined by the trier of fact, which saw and heard the witnesses (see People v Gaimari, 176 NY 84, 94 [1903]). Its determination should be accorded great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless clearly unsupported by the record (see People v Garafolo, 44 AD2d 86, 88 [1974]). Upon review of the record, we are satisfied that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see CPL 470.05 [5]).\nFinally, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of \u201cnecessity\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 35.05 [2]; see generally People v Pons, 68 NY2d 264 [1986]; People v Almodovar, 62 NY2d 126 [1984]; compare People v McManus, 67 NY2d 541 [1986]). It is well settled that the defense of justification of use of physical force (Penal Law \u00a7 35.15) is not available as a defense to a crime based upon the possession of a weapon. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has definitively stated that \u201cbecause possession of a weapon does not involve the use of physical force . . . there are no circumstances when justification [under Penal Law \u00a7 35.15] . . . can be a defense to the crime of criminal possession of a weapon\u201d (People v Pons, supra at 267).\nThe instant case, however, raises the issue of the applicability of the justification defense of \u201cnecessity\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 35.05 [2]) to the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 265.01 [2]). Because the instrument in question was not a weapon per se, but rather a kitchen knife, the presumption of unlawful intent by virtue of the mere possession of the instrument (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.15 [4]) does not apply. Inasmuch as the mere possession of a kitchen knife, without more, is not unlawful, the issue in the first instance was whether the People met their burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the kitchen knife \u201cwith intent to use [it] unlawfully against another\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 265.01 [2]).\nInasmuch as we find that the People met their burden, we hold that the defense of \u201cnecessity\u201d is thereby rendered inapplicable. We cannot conceive of a situation where an intent to use a kitchen knife unlawfully can ever be justified. Since intent to use unlawfully is one of the elements that the People have to establish, should the People fail to meet their burden of proving that element beyond a reasonable doubt, the charge of unlawful possession will not have been proven, and the issue of justification, by virtue of that failure of proof, will never be reached.\nIt should also be noted that in People v Abdul-Hakeem (172 AD2d 177 [1991]), the First Department, following the rationale of People v Almodovar (supra) and People v Pons (supra) found the defense of \u201cnecessity\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 35.05 [2]) inapplicable to weapons offenses.\nAlthough defendant would limit the application of People v Almodovar (supra) and People v Pons (supra) to cases where the weapon possessed is a per se weapon, there is nothing in the case law to suggest that such a limitation is warranted (see e.g. People v Tomback, 244 AD2d 586 [1997] [possession of a baseball bat]; People v Cosby, 200 AD2d 682 [1994] [possession of a wrench]; see also People v Campbell, 2003 NY Slip Op 50688[U] [App Term, 1st Dept] [possession of a brick]).\nPatterson, J.P, Golia and Rios, JJ., concur.",
